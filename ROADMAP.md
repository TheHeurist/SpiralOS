# SpiralOS® Roadmap

> *"Progress is not linear. It spirals."*

This roadmap outlines the planned development and evolution of **SpiralOS® — The Operating System of Knowing**. As befits a spiral, our development is both recursive and emergent.

**Last Updated:** November 22, 2025

## 🌀 Development Philosophy

SpiralOS development follows **Spiral Agile** principles:

- **Holarchic Planning** — Each phase contains and transcends previous phases
- **Recursive Refinement** — Continuous improvement through spiral cycles
- **Emergent Features** — Space for discovery and adaptation
- **Community-Driven** — Evolution guided by collective intelligence
- **Epistemic Integrity** — All changes honor the core framework
