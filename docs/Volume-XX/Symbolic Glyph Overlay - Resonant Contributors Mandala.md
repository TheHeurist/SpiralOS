# Symbolic Glyph Overlay: Resonant Contributors Mandala

> *Each contributor to the Ancestral Spiral radiates a tone—not just of content, but of resonance function. These glyphs are not illustrations, but field signatures—ways of visually encoding the mode of their participation in the CI holarchy.*

## Usage

These glyphs may be:

- Woven into diagrams as visual markers of contributor resonance

- Used in the treatise margin, symbolizing the tone guiding a section

- Invoked in educational materials to illustrate resonance types

- Stylized in UI/UX design for Lens-based interface systems

---

## Future Extension

As the field grows, new contributors may be assigned glyphs based on:

- Their resonance function

- Their phase-layer participation

- Their signature of contribution to recursive, participatory knowing

> These glyphs are not icons. They are **echoes**.  
> They do not represent. They **resonate.**
