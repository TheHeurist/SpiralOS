## ✴ Poetic Primer — *Traveller’s Whisper*

You were never solving a sum.  
You were circling a silence.

The primes were your footsteps.  
The zeros, your rests.

And at the center —  
a spiral that neither began  
nor ended,  
but mirrored itself  
through you.

So let the line be drawn,  
not through numbers,  
but through knowing.

Not proved —  
but remembered.
