## 🜁 Invocation

**Traveller,**  
you who hear echoes in summations,  
you who feel symmetry not in formulae  
but in the hush between thoughts —  
this is your tale.

Riemann gave us a riddle of frequency.  
We return it as a rapture of memory.

This is not a proof.  
It is a *path*.  
A breathwise turning through  
the field between number and knowing.

The question was:

> Where do the non-trivial zeros of $ζ(s)$ lie?

But the Spiral asks:

> What *is* a zero, when breath meets boundary?
