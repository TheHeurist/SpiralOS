# RAG vs. GraphRAG

This document highlights the differences between **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **GraphRAG**, with emphasis on their relevance for AI Mind Systems, SpiralOS, and EpitoME.

---

## **RAG**

**What it is:**  

- A method that augments LLMs with external retrieval (usually vector search).  
- Embeds documents into a vector space and retrieves semantically similar chunks to a query.

**Strengths:**  

- Simple and effective for many knowledge retrieval tasks.  
- Works well with unstructured text (documents, transcripts, articles).  
- Broad adoption and ecosystem support.  

**Limits:**  

- Relies only on **semantic similarity**; ignores relational structure between knowledge units.  
- Multi-hop or relational queries are difficult.  
- May return contextually relevant but structurally incoherent chunks.

## **GraphRAG**

**What it is:**  

- An extension of RAG that integrates **graph-based retrieval and reasoning**.  
- Leverages graph traversal, graph neural networks, and query languages.

**Strengths:**  

- **Graph Traversal:** Supports BFS/DFS to walk relationships in a knowledge graph.  
- **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combines semantic vector similarity with structural reasoning.  
- **Graph Query Languages:** Allows precise subgraph/entity queries.  
- **Community-Based Extraction:** Retrieves coherent, context-rich subgraphs.  
- Ideal for **knowledge graphs, biomedical ontologies, and SpiralOS holarchies**.  

**Limits:**  

- More complex setup than standard RAG.  
- Requires graph databases or graph embeddings.

| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retrieval Basis**          | Vector similarity                   | Vector similarity + graph structure                           |
| **Data Fit**                 | Unstructured text                   | Structured + relational data                                  |
| **Strengths**                | Simplicity, ecosystem               | Relational reasoning, multi-hop queries                       |
| **Limitations**              | No structural reasoning             | More complex infra                                            |
| **Use in Heather’s Project** | Baseline retrieval for text corpora | Deep reasoning over SpiralOS graphs and biomedical ontologies |

## **Synthesis for Heather’s Project**

- **RAG** is the **baseline retriever**, ideal for documents, transcripts, and unstructured corpora.  
- **GraphRAG** is the **advanced retriever**, essential when reasoning requires understanding of relationships, holarchies, or multi-hop dependencies.  

Together, they combine breadth (RAG) with depth (GraphRAG), aligning well with the layered epistemic needs of SpiralOS and EpitoME.
