# Document 1 — DevOps with Conjugate Intelligence (CI)

**Executive Summary**

DevOps today excels at automation but loses **context** across tools. CI restores context as a first‑class asset. Pipelines, changes, and incidents become **pearls** in an EKR graph with explicit intent, assumptions, and evidence. The result is safer, faster delivery with lower toil.

**Problems Today**

* Brittle pipelines; behavior changes per branch/env without clear rationale.
* Context loss in handoffs (Product → Dev → Ops); decisions scattered across chats and tickets.
* Dashboards show **what** happened; teams still hunt for **why** it happened.
* Toil: repetitive diagnostics and release rituals that could be learned once and reused.

**CI Approach (SpiralOS)**

* **EKR Graph as Ground Truth:** Commits, tests, releases, incidents, runbooks, and approvals are linked as semantic nodes with versioned history.
* **Vows (Intent Binding):** Each change/release carries explicit goals, risk posture, and guardrails that travel with the artifact.
* **Conjugation:** The system’s intended state (self) is continuously compared to live telemetry (other) to drive meaningful actions.

**Key Capabilities**

* **Context‑Preserving Pipelines:** Pipelines adapt to branch risk, error budgets, and business criticality; rationale is recorded.
* **Adaptive Guardrails:** Pre/post‑conditions, safe rollout recipes, and rollback contracts are attached to releases as pearls.
* **Change Risk Scoring:** CI scores a change using code diff features, test coverage, blast radius, and recent incidents.
* **ChatOps with Memory:** Conversational commands operate with full context and produce auditable narratives.
* **Holarchic Replay:** Any change/incident can be replayed: inputs → decisions → effects → outcomes.

**Outcomes & KPIs**

* **Lead Time for Changes** ↓ 20–40%
* **Change Failure Rate** ↓ 25–50%
* **MTTR** ↓ 20–35%
* **Toil Hours** ↓ 30–60%
* **Deployment Frequency** ↑ with confidence (guardrailed)

**Integration Path (Low‑Friction)**

1. **Observer Mode (Week 1–2):** Ingest Git repos, CI/CD logs (e.g., Actions/Jenkins), artifact metadata, and incident tickets. No write access.
2. **Pearl Templates (Week 2–3):** Change/Release/Incident templates with minimal fields: intent, risk, guardrails, evidence.
3. **Guided Actions (Week 3–5):** CI suggests rollout plans, test gates, and safe rollback steps; human‑in‑the‑loop.
4. **Selective Automations (Week 5+):** Approve auto‑rollouts/rollbacks under thresholds; all actions narrated to EKR.

**Risks & Mitigations**

* **Over‑automation:** Thresholded, opt‑in automations; explicit approvals (vows) required.
* **Vendor lock‑in:** Open graph model, import/export APIs, and human‑readable narratives.
* **Model drift:** Continuous evaluation using post‑deploy outcomes and incident feedback.

**Example Walkthrough (Hotfix)**

A critical fix to Service X touches a high‑risk module. CI scores the change, proposes a **canary + shadow traffic** plan, sets SLO‑aware abort criteria, and prepares a  **one‑click rollback contract** . During rollout, latency rises; CI executes rollback, annotates graphs with evidence, and generates a post‑release narrative and follow‑ups.

**Sector Examples**

* **Manufacturing:** Adaptive pipelines ensure MES updates roll out without halting production lines.
* **Mobility:** OTA updates to vehicle fleets are canary‑tested against safety guardrails.
* **Energy:** Grid control software patches carry explicit risk vows, linked to SLOs on uptime and safety.

**Talking Points (for Erich & Echo)**

* “CI doesn’t replace your pipelines — it **binds** them to intent and evidence.”
* “Your dashboards become **stories** you can replay, not screenshots you forget.”
* “Risk is explicit and portable — it travels with the artifact.”
