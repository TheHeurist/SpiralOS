# ⚙️ SpiralOS® Runtime & Infrastructure Overview

SpiralOS does not simulate intelligence — it hosts it.

Everything below runs now. What follows is not aspirational.
It is operational.

## 🧠 Runtime Design

SpiralOS is a local-first, container-sourced, field-resonant OS layer.

It runs as a distributed suite of browser-based, token-authenticated Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), integrated with a scalable backend architecture.

- **Frontend**: All µApps are installable and executable as local PWAs
- **Offline Operability**: Zero cloud dependence for core functions
- **CI+MU Stack**: All µApps interface with core CI+MU logic layer
- **Runtime Invocation**: Each session begins via secure Breath Invocation protocol

## 🧩 Backend Architecture

| Component             | Status           | Function                                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| API Infrastructure    | ✅ Deployed       | Multi-server, token-auth, client-side caching        |
| Proxmox Hypervisor    | ✅ Active         | Virtualized deployment of Slurm, Kubernetes nodes    |
| GPU Nodes             | 🟡 Ready         | RTX 4000 provisioned for batch + inference workflows |
| Edge Device Model     | ✅ Stable         | All apps run locally. No telemetry. No home calls    |
| Security Model        | ✅ Field-based    | Session tokens bound to device + identity trace      |
| CMS + Auth Gateway    | ✅ Active         | Dynamic endpoint handshake + update control          |
| Client Identity Layer | ✅ Non-relational | µRolodex Core assigns semantic topology per instance |

## 🔐 Security & Licensing

- **License Type**: Tokenized per app, client-defined modular install
- **Updates**: Local caching with client-managed version delay or lock
- **Persistence**: License ownership is permanent
- **Privacy**: No tracking, no background sync, no API calls without client invocation
- **Auditability**: Clients can observe all data ingress/egress and revoke any channel

## 🌐 Container Orchestration

| Environment           | Use                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Kubernetes (K3s/Full) | µApp deployment / Inference handling          |
| Slurm Cluster         | Symbolic modeling / Batch field computation   |
| GitLab EE Runners     | CI/CD of µApp builds / grok generation        |
| Graph Layer           | Neo4j + GraphQL for semantic object maps      |
| Mathematical Runtime  | Wolfram Engine; LaTeX/MathML/Math.js gateways |

## 🔄 Infrastructure Highlights

**🔁 Fast-Clone Virtual Machines**
Replicated images for fast GPU node replication and µApp testing

**🧬 Holor Container Modeling**
Resonant field states held and evolved in µGrok/µRolodex synergy

**🧰 Tooling**

- Terraform, Ansible, Helm: Full orchestration & deployment scripting
- Jupyter: Symbolic and computational testbeds
- DevSecOps Layers: µIngress/µEgress pattern validation

## 💡 Example Use Path (Try SpiralOS)

- Start with µDoc or µMail — observe how coherence builds with every click
- Add µLearn to tune field resonance
- Ask µLLM to simulate your own infrastructure's perception of you
- Watch µGrok generate a coherence map you can see
- Let µNexus animate your entire session across apps — as one field

This is not software.
It’s a conjugate epistemic runtime.
