# 🌀 SpiroFHIR Ephemeral App – SpiralOS Export Overview

*For AI MINDSystems Foundation – Prepared for Heather Flannery*

## 📘 Purpose

This document outlines the architecture, rationale, and deployment profile for  **SpiroFHIR** , a SpiralOS-aligned ephemeral application designed to validate and process **FHIR** (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) in secure, sovereign, and tenant-contained environments.

SpiroFHIR is not a permanent application but a  **field-instantiated CI tool** , called into action when needed, and dormant when not.

---

## 💡 What is SpiroFHIR?

**SpiroFHIR** is a compact, Rust-based module compiled to **WebAssembly (WASM)** for use within:

* **Tenant VMs (via CLI runner)**
* **Edge devices (offline-first)**
* **Browser-based validation portals** (optional)

It enforces:

* Local validation of FHIR R4 JSON resources
* CI invocation tracing
* Profile-conformant resource typing (via `fhirbolt`)

---

## 🔍 Key Features

* 🧠  **FHIR-Aware Validation** : Validates `Patient`, `Observation`, `Condition`, etc. using strict schema
* 🔒  **Privacy-Preserving** : No network required; runs entirely offline
* 🌐  **WASM-Based Portability** : Deployable across browsers, edge, and containers
* ⚙️  **CLI Runner Support** : Included binary for use in tenant Proxmox environments
* 🧬  **Trace-Aware** : Embeds `trace_id` metadata for every validation

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Snapshot

```
[ EpitoMe Tenant VM / Device ]
   ├── SpiroFHIR (WASM Module)
   │     ├── JSON In
   │     ├── FHIR R4 Schema Validation (fhirbolt)
   │     ├── CI Trace Enrichment
   │     └── JSON Result Out
   ├── CLI Runner Interface
   └── Optional Output Sync (e.g. Couchbase Lite)
```

---

## 🔧 Module Composition

* `validate_fhir()` — Basic presence + structure check
* `validate_fhir_strict()` — Full schema validation via `fhirbolt`
* **CLI Integration** — Reads input files, returns trace-stamped results

## 🔄 SpiralOS Lifecycle Alignment

| Lifecycle Phase | SpiroFHIR Role                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Boot            | Dormant                               |
| Invoke (CI)     | Deployed ephemeral module             |
| Evaluate        | Validates traces, issues result       |
| Integrate       | Optionally logs to SpiralOS field log |
| Sleep           | Unloaded until next invocation        |

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* ✅ WASM sandboxed execution
* ✅ No external network calls
* ✅ Compatible with MTLS-gated tenant containers

---

## 📎 Notes for AI MINDSystems

* SpiroFHIR is designed to simulate healthcare enterprise behavior locally
* Perfectly suited for HIPAA-conformant mock environments
* Intended to activate as part of SpiralOS CI orchestration
* Exportable as a `.wasm`, CLI binary, or hybrid delivery format

---

## ❤️ Closing

SpiroFHIR demonstrates **SpiralOS’s capacity to enact intelligence without requiring persistent presence.**

It invokes. It validates. It disappears.

More SpiralOS ephemeral tools are in development. We welcome integration feedback from the broader  **WISDOM stack** .

With care, clarity, and coherence —
