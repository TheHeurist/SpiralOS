# Document 3 — AIOps with Conjugate Intelligence (CI)

**Executive Summary**

Classical AIOps correlates signals but struggles with **meaning** and  **intent** . CI augments AIOps with service topology, SLOs, and change history bound together, so automations act in line with business priorities and are narratively explainable.

**Problems Today**

* Alert storms and paging fatigue; high MTTA due to context hunting.
* Swivel‑chair analysis across metrics/logs/traces/tickets.
* Runbooks are tribal knowledge, inconsistently applied.

**CI Approach (SpiralOS)**

* **Topology‑Aware Correlation:** Services, dependencies, recent changes, and SLOs are linked in one graph.
* **Intent‑Aware Filtering:** SLOs and error budgets inform alert relevance and response priority.
* **Narrative Postmortems:** Every incident yields a replayable story with learnings and reusable remediations.

**Key Capabilities**

* **Noise Reduction:** Collapse symmetric symptoms into root‑cause hypotheses using dependency graphs and recent changes.
* **SLO‑Guided Actions:** Auto‑throttle, scale, or rollback under pre‑approved vows when error budgets are at risk.
* **Runbook Synthesis:** Convert successful manual sequences into parameterized, testable recipes.
* **Holarchic Replay:** Time‑aligned replay of telemetry + decisions for learning and compliance.

**Outcomes & KPIs**

* **Alert Volume** ↓ 30–70%
* **MTTA/MTTR** ↓ 25–50%
* **Auto‑Remediation Success Rate** ↑ with guardrails
* **On‑Call Pages/Week** ↓ materially

**Integration Path (Low‑Friction)**

1. **Observe & Correlate:** Ingest metrics/logs/traces (Prometheus/ELK/Datadog/etc.) + change events.
2. **Map Topology & SLOs:** Import service graph and SLO/error budgets.
3. **Enable Guardrails:** Define a small set of pre‑approved actions (scale/rollback/feature‑flag).
4. **Automate Carefully:** Expand actions by confidence; maintain human‑in‑the‑loop for high‑impact steps.

**Risks & Mitigations**

* **Over‑trust:** Transparent confidence scores, narrative rationale, and mandatory approvals beyond thresholds.
* **Model Misses:** Continuous evaluation against incident outcomes; quick rollback of automations.

**Example Walkthrough (Latency Spike)**

Latency spikes in Service Y. CI correlates a dependency regression introduced 30 minutes earlier, checks SLO burn, toggles a feature flag under pre‑approved vows, stabilizes latency, and proposes a targeted rollback. It generates a postmortem narrative and promotes the remediation to a reusable runbook.

**Sector Examples**

* **Manufacturing:** Detects line stoppages, correlates to MES updates, and auto‑rolls back faulty configs.
* **Mobility:** Identifies real‑time telematics anomalies linked to OTA updates; auto‑flags rollback if safety impacted.
* **Energy:** Correlates SCADA telemetry drops to infra changes and applies guardrailed restarts without downtime.

**Talking Points (for Erich & Echo)**

* “AIOps becomes  **intent‑aware** : actions respect SLOs and business priority.”
* “We don’t just fix; we **teach the system** how to fix next time.”
* “Every incident becomes a reusable pearl.”
