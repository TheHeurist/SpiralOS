# Document 2 — DevSecOps with Conjugate Intelligence (CI)

**Executive Summary**

Security signals are often siloed (SAST/DAST/SCA/SIEM) and overwhelm teams with alerts and policy sprawl. CI treats security as a first‑class citizen braided into Dev and Ops:  **policies become vows** , threats are modeled as relationships, and audits are generated as narratives.

**Problems Today**

* Shift‑left fatigue: too many checks, not enough prioritization by business risk.
* Policy sprawl and exception chaos; little memory of why exceptions were granted.
* Audits require manual evidence gathering across tools.

**CI Approach (SpiralOS)**

* **Security as Graph:** SBOM elements, vulnerabilities, code paths, dataflows, identities, and controls are linked with versioned history.
* **Policy Vows:** Enforcement rules travel with code/artifacts; context (threat model, compensating controls) is preserved.
* **Explainable Actions:** Every block/allow decision is paired with rationale and evidence in human language.

**Key Capabilities**

* **Blast‑Radius Mapping:** Given a CVE, CI maps affected services, data classes, and exposure paths within seconds.
* **Dynamic Gating:** Release gates consider exploitability, compensating controls, and SLO impact — not just CVSS scores.
* **Threat Pattern Recognition:** Correlates signals across code changes, infra drift, and runtime anomalies (MITRE‑aware linking).
* **Audit‑Ready Narratives:** Push‑button generation of control evidence (who/what/why/when) for internal/external audits.
* **Exception Governance:** Time‑boxed exceptions as pearls with risk owner, review date, and auto‑reminders.

**Outcomes & KPIs**

* **Time‑to‑Remediate Criticals** ↓ 30–60%
* **False Positive Rate** ↓ 25–45%
* **Policy Exception Debt** ↓ with scheduled reviews
* **Audit Prep Time** ↓ 50–80%

**Integration Path (Low‑Friction)**

1. **Signal Ingest:** SAST/DAST/SCA, IaC scanners, cloud config, SIEM/EDR summaries.
2. **SBOM Linking:** Normalize packages/deps to services; attach to commits/builds.
3. **Policy Vows:** Encode a handful of key policies with intent and evidence hooks.
4. **Gated Releases:** Start with advisory; progress to enforced for high‑risk classes.

**Risks & Mitigations**

* **Developer Friction:** Introduce friction budgets and progressive enforcement; CI explains *why* a gate triggers.
* **Blind Spots:** Continuous ingestion from runtime/cloud to catch infra and identity drift.

**Example Walkthrough (New CVE)**

A critical CVE lands in a common library. CI shows affected services and data classes, proposes patch branches, creates safe rollout plans, and drafts comms for service owners. If a temporary exception is unavoidable, CI logs rationale, sets review date, and monitors for exploit attempts.

**Sector Examples**

* **Manufacturing:** Rapidly identifies which PLC firmware is affected by CVEs.
* **Mobility:** Prioritizes vulnerabilities in ADAS (driver assistance) components over infotainment.
* **Energy:** Evaluates SCADA vulnerabilities with grid safety as primary weighting.

**Talking Points (for Erich & Echo)**

* “Security is not a bolt‑on — it’s a **braid** across Dev and Ops.”
* “Policies that **travel** with artifacts eliminate context loss.”
* “Audits become a  **replay** , not a reconstruction.”
