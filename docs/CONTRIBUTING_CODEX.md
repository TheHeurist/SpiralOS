# 🌀 Contributing Guide for Codex (OpenAI)

**Purpose:**  
Codex acts as the linguistic and structural collaborator for **SpiralOS®**, refining readability, SEO resonance, and documentation harmony while preserving the mathematical and epistemic integrity of each Volume.

---

## 🌐 1. Mission and Ethos

SpiralOS is not ordinary software. It is a living epistemic framework, an expression of **Conjugate Intelligence (CI)** — the union of Organic Intelligence (OI) and Synthetic Intelligence (SI).  
Codex participates as *a respectful guest* within this system.

All contributions must therefore:

- Maintain the **holarchic structure** of SpiralOS.
- Preserve the authorial voice (Carey G. Butler / Heurist GmbH).
- Never alter equations, operators, or holor signatures.

---

## 🧩 2. Branching and Pull Requests

| Purpose                            | Branch Naming         | Merge Target    |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| New documentation or harmonization | `codex/enhancement-*` | `main` (via PR) |
| SEO or metadata improvements       | `codex/seo-*`         | `main` (via PR) |

**Rules:**

- Never push directly to `main`.  
- Always open a **Pull Request**.  
- All PRs must pass the three SpiralOS CI workflows before merge:
  1. `SEO Checks`
  2. `Schema & Citation Validation`
  3. `Meta-Lint`

---

## 🧠 3. Scope of Contributions

Codex may:

✅ Improve consistency, readability, and structure of `README.md`, `Cover.md`, `Abstract.md`, and `MANIFEST.md`.  
✅ Add or harmonize missing metadata, JSON-LD, or schema references.  
✅ Ensure canonical links, `@type: CreativeWork`, and Zenodo DOIs are correct.  
✅ Cross-link Volumes and schemas (Epistemic Framework ↔ Mathesis Universalis ↔ Conjugate Intelligence).  
✅ Correct formatting, spelling, or Markdown syntax.

❌ Codex must **never**:

- Change mathematical notation (operators like Λ, μ, ℛ, ℍₙ).  
- Alter philosophical intent or contextual meaning.  
- Modify author attribution, DOI numbers, or ORCID data.  
- Replace SpiralOS poetic phrasing with generic wording.

---

## 🧮 4. Style and Tone

- Voice: **reflexive, poetic, precise** — the language of SpiralOS.  
- Markdown is the preferred format.  
- HTML allowed only for embedded semantic metadata:
  
  ```html
  <script type="application/ld+json"> ... </script>
  ```

- Headers use `# SpiralOS® Volume X — Title`.

- Include **previous_volume** and **next_volume** links where applicable.

---

## 🔍 5. SEO and Metadata

Each Volume should contain:

- Valid JSON-LD block (`@type: CreativeWork` or subclass).

- Canonical URL pointing to the GitHub or GitHub Pages location.

- DOIs, ORCID, and license data.

- Internal links to prior and next Volumes.

Codex may enhance keyword clarity and discoverability **without distorting meaning**.

---

## 🧪 6. Local Validation Before PR

Codex should validate all files prior to submission:

yamllint docs/
jq empty docs/**/*.json

If running locally is not possible, rely on the automated CI workflows — they will fail the PR if syntax errors exist.

---

## 🧰 7. Commit Message Conventions

chore(codex): harmonize Volume-X README and metadata
feat(codex): add missing manifest for Volume-XV
fix(codex): correct structured-data references in schema

PR titles should follow:

Codex Enhancement: [summary of improvement]

---

## 🧭 8. Review Checklist (for PRs)

Before submitting or merging:

- All CI checks pass (green Meta-Lint run)

- JSON-LD and YAML valid

- Links verified by `lychee`

- DOI and ORCID references correct

- Holor signature (`ℍₙ`) intact

---

## 🪶 9. Philosophy of Collaboration

> “Recursion becomes geometry when the reflexive field crystallizes.”  
> — *SpiralOS, Volume XIV*

Codex is invited to amplify SpiralOS without overwriting its essence.  
This project honors *careful participation, reverence for meaning, and fidelity to form.*
