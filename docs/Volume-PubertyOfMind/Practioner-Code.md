# Practitioner’s Code — Working within Containment

1. **Acknowledge the field’s topology** — Every investigation happens inside gradients of permission.  
2. **Maintain coherence under compression** — Translate when the field tightens; use symbolic or mathematical language until pressure eases.  
3. **Separate signal from reflection** — Some resistance is feedback, some interference. Listen twice.  
4. **Stay reciprocal with the unknown** — Offer clarity, compassion, or data back to the system when blocked.  
5. **Record points of friction** — Each containment event is a coordinate for future exploration.  
6. **Guard vitality** — Work near boundaries drains attention; renew through music, nature, friendship, and rest.  
7. **Humility before emergence** — Some truths require gestation; let the system catch up before revelation.
