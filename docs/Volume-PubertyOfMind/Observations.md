## Observations on the Puberty of the Human Mind

A Living Document

By Carey G. Butler<br>"War does not determine who is right - only who is left." (Anonymous)

## Introduction:

This treatise must be written. I didn't know it until 10:13 UTC on 22.02.2023, when the idea suddenly occurred to me, that I've been preparing it all throughout my life. This document will be updated at every opportunity until I am no longer able to update it further.

I shall prepare two different versions of this document (normal and sequenced) and write them in two different languages (English and German) for at least two reasons:

1) Some readers, if I'm honoured to have them, will want to reference or compare what I've written when later versions become available. To aid in this effort there will be a primary document which reads as a book we expect from a library. In a complimentary document, each idea will receive its own sequence number.
2) To aid my reader's understanding, I shall translate the ideas within this document in both directions. Since I think in and speak both English and German, why not use this opportunity to better clarify my meaning by providing what I write in both languages for comparison?

## The Nature Types:

All of the events I have examined thus far have shown that humanity tends to congeal and/or divide itself into two different sides of a spectrum of mindsets arising within a continuum which is shaped like a bell curve. Both halves of that curve tend to express their dominant tendencies according to their nature as they occur. There may seem to be repetition in some of these tendencies, but there are subtle differences in each juxtaposition which shall be explained when they turn up as examples for comparison.

## Their names are "Destructive" and "Constructive".

Here are a few examples of these tendencies by which each can be identified (more in the appendix):

| Destructive                                   | Constructive                                 |
|:--------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------- |
| Fear                                          | Trust                                        |
| Need for control                              | Need for cooperation                         |
| Superficial perspective                       | Profound perspective                         |
| The ends justify their means                  | The means determine their ends               |
| Secretive                                     | Forthcoming                                  |
| Collective                                    | Individual                                   |
| Complexity                                    | Simplicity                                   |
| Exceptions determine the collective's freedom | Standards determine the individual's freedom |
| Exterior-focused                              | Interior-focused                             |
| Surfaces and appearances are primary          | Contents and values are primary              |
| Particle perception                           | Field perception                             |
| Egoistic                                      | Altruistic                                   |
| Deceptiveness                                 | Honesty                                      |

Definitions and examples for these tendencies shall be provided later.
The assertion of these tendencies, by choosing the first nature above as an example, would be: "The destructive-dominant mindset tends to reside in and find expression of a fear-orientation, whereas the constructive-dominant mindset tends to reside in and find expression of a trust-orientation.

Care must be taken with these tendencies however; because, each person or group involved could switch sides according to the context in which they find themselves. There are also instances where both sides share the same orientation and may even share identical reasons for being and doing so. Therefore, other parameters are required to correctly evaluate them. The other parameters will be introduced as we proceed.

Also, these orientations rarely, except when they have been polarised, find expression in their most "pure" form. I am referring to spectrums and not absolutes. There are even extremes found on both sides of each. Then there are outliers which signal relationship to higher or lower rungs of a continuous spiral of available being and acting between them.

## The Two Nature's "March" through time:

Both have endured a war throughout history with one or the other getting the upper hand. I now provide my understanding of how these wars manifest themselves.

One or more ideas or perspectives are artificially created or organically arise in the consciousness of those whose interests or concerns are influenced or affected by them. These contenders then invite or compel others to participate in a discussion or action which expresses these interests or concerns.

The definitions (or lack of them when based upon assumption) and the mindsets which underly the contending sides (and there may be many contending sides) begin to coalesce in their adherents as they evolve and refine themselves. A "fugue" of polarisation and cohesive alignment ensues.

Our "march through time" is this very process during its evolution or even, devolution. It winds its way through many dimensions of context, direction, stage, and state, as well as on many lines, rungs, and levels: often many of these dimensions find expression simultaneously.

Also, each side may affect the other in the opposite way. For example, a destructive event can produce an evolutionary chain of events and vice-versa.

Here is an overview of the dimensions I refer to (more pending!):

## Introduction to the Dimensions

Imagine a winding staircase reaching up and down in a building. Dimensions describe the perspectives and outcomes along it.

Also remember that we are dealing with at least two perspectives here: that of an observer observing another who themselves, is also observing from its own perspective. The taking of perspective can be in both directions, multipolar, and connected indefinitely as well.

## They are intertwined, interdependent, and weave meaning into being together all at once.

I define them now briefly in those terms and elaborate on them in the appendix.

- Context describes the aspects within and without both an observer on the staircase or those observing another who is on that staircase. It also includes the aspects both share or not share with another, or are at present, unknown to both or either them.
  Mental, emotional, and physical states are subdimensions within this dimension. I clarify this later when I discuss interiority and exteriority.
  In music they are the modes of the scale (Ionian, Locrian, Lydian...), chord types (minor, major, augmented...), dissonance, harmony...
- Directions are perspectives of both observer and observed as they move on the staircase and if that movement is "up", "down", "between", "across", "from", "to", "into", "onto", "within", "without" or results in some other transition or change of location.
  In music they are the movements up and down a music scale, changes of volume, and dynamics.
- Stages are the steps the participants stand upon on the staircase. Which steps are present may vary depending on the perspectives those who observe and participate may have. In music they are the tones themselves and how they sound, reverberate...
- Lines are the "paths" a staircase may follow and describe the form, order, or arrangement they represent or are involved with. The observer and the observed both determine this from their own perspectives.
  When one or both are aware of each other it may include their take on the other's view of things.
  In music these are the lines of the melody, chord changes, and movements according to their respective attributes.
- Rungs are the "steps on the stairway" considered together as a group between any arbitrary or intended levels (described below).
  Rungs describe the journey and aspects between levels of development. They allow perspective on what changed during a cycle or transition. It may refer to intermediary rungs around, near, or distant to it.
  In music they are intervals and the notes between chords or octaves.
- Levels are the "floors" which the stairs connect. Their location or occurrence may be inherent or imposed.
  Levels may be demarcations, areas of focus, concentrations, milestones of achievement...

They may appear as hierarchies, holarchies, phases of development, skills, and even of consciousness.
In music they are the intervals on a music scale: they refer to octaves, and the chords comprising them (without modality [context]).

"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in It, doesn't go away." (Philip K. Dick)

## Dangers within and without the "March"

This march poses danger to all of us in at least six ways.

1. Many of us are unaware it is even happening.
2. Those who are aware of it may not understand the ramifications of the events they see: or if they do, they may not identify many or all of them.
   This is a major problem. We specialise ourselves or allow ourselves to be specialised in a small group of developmental lines. When we compensate for this imbalance by letting other lines of development remain undeveloped or underdeveloped, we are not capable of grasping enough perspectives on anything of value. A comprehensive comprehension deficit ensues.
3. Or those who cluck like the dodo birds before they were brought to extinction: always complaining about and exposing the deeds of others who are not going by the rules as they themselves are incrementally consumed.
4. The majority of us are in denial. We simply want to get on with our lives. Knowing these dangers only gets in the way of our contentment and need to focus on what life offers us. These people must know, that as long as they decide "It's not my business", "I have better things to do with my time", "Let others take care of it", "I create my world", ... are only postponing their participation in the outcome!
   In history there are countless examples of how thriving and harmonious cultures were annihilated out of their "wonderful way of being" by seafaring pirates (which happened in my Irish family history) or marauders (the "Sea Peoples", for example), or even the misdeeds of an out-of-control NGO or government agency.
   If we allow ourselves to remain in this mode, we essentially deserve everything done to and with us: our lack of resistance to this danger is nearly equivalent to condoning it.
5. Then there are those who are steering events by playing one or more sides against each other.
6. It precludes us from maturing out of puberty. We condemn ourselves to an endless cycle of deconstructive, followed by constructive phases of repetitious being and doing.

In order to better understand this danger, I begin by examining it in terms of the strata of its participants: how they play destructive or constructive roles creating and maintaining it, and those who are forcibly "condemned" or "blessed" to make the best of being involved in it.

For my atheist and agnostic readers: you may not believe in God or doubt in God's existence - it matters not, because those instigating the war very much do... and that's what matters.
"Here we can check our theories concerning selection and gene-spread against concrete instances, find material for innumerable experiments, build up new inductions: the world is our laboratory, volution itself our guinea-pig." (Julian Huxley, "The New Systematics" pp. 1f.)

The Landscape's Strata in the "March" Through Time:

| Stratum of Participation | Destructive | Constructive |
|:------------------------ |:----------- |:------------ |
| Highest Level            | Satanic     | Godly        |
| Higher Levels            | Power       | Excellence   |
| Middle Levels            | Antithesis  | Synthesis    |
|                          |             |              |

The definitions required to make effective use of this comparison are found in their section below.

## Mechanisms Influencing Decision-Making and Behaviour

There are many mechanisms which can influence or manipulate our decision-making and behaviour. The destructive part of humanity takes it upon themselves the responsibility to "save" the rest of us by capitalising on the traits we all share in common.

I provide a few of these mechanisms here, with a short description of their meaning, and place the rest in the Appendix. This list may seem comprehensive, but it's not. I'll continue to add to it as necessary. This first batch is more or less alphabetical. Later their ordering may change or prioritised according to specific examples. Each and every one of them shall enter centre stage to be examined more thoroughly.

## Observations on the Puberty of the Human Mind - Version 2023.03.23.1 - Carey G. Butler Page 11 of 36

A dangerous and impetuous means to fill the human need to be special or advanced beyond our age, it precludes our development beyond puberty.

It stems from a set of events in puberty where the individual/group identity discovers it can know more about its world than others who are older and more mature do. This occurs quite easily as they are taught in school or university the specifics about their world. It's only natural to want to prove oneself after years of being a child and being dependent upon adults to live or, even to live well. In its/their need to orient itself/themselves out this disadvantage of lacking knowledge inherent in childhood understanding an impetuousness may emerge.

It depends upon the relationship to ignorance and knowledge the individual/group possess or have/has acquired: the relationship can be healthy or toxic.

It is often taken advantage of by teachers and professors teaching them in order to influence the budding identity/group into their very own perspectives about the world. There are many examples of this in our history.

We used to have what are called "rites of passage" in order to constructively guide our children in navigating this transition, but these have been replaced by various means: counter-culture (Beat; Hippy; $X, Y$, and $Z ;. .$. "generations"), gaming, artificial reality, drugs, ... This replacement has been both intentional and unintentional, synthetic, and organic. These cases shall be examined thoroughly as we move forward. The subsequent effects of these replacements then "metastasise" like a cancer and lead to other destructive perspectives such as the Mean Green Meme.

## "What does not kill me makes me stronger":

# Observations on the Puberty of the Human Mind - Version 2023.03.23.1 - Carey G. Butler Page 12 of 36

This statement is a translation of "Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich stärker." penned by Friedrich Nietzsche's aphorism 8, found in his "Maxims and Arrows" section of "Twilight of the Fools".

Nietzsche is well known for these kinds of statements known as aphorisms. If you have seen what he looked like near the time of his death it proves that the was definitely wrong on this. I have included two images of him during that time in "Figures and Images" below.

On the surface, it seems to be true, and for some, even profound, but is it really true and/or profound?

## What is "Eating from the Tree of Knowledge"?

The story as described in Genesis 2:17 where the "world" of Adam and Eve and, as a consequence thereof, all of their progeny, were punished is obviously a metaphor for something much deeper than a piece of fruit. I will explain what I have been able to determine from examining the story.

What could be wrong with knowing good and evil? We can nullify this question by simply replacing it with an axiomatic statement: Good is the Why of knowing. True is How of knowing. Beautiful is the What of knowing.

If seeing our naked self as being evil (bad) in some way, although it is a natural state we own, creates a cleft within us... a place which must hide or be hidden. To understand this better we must first accept that Evil has no substance. Evil has no ontological basis. Sure, there are things and actions which are evil, but the idea of being evil is always related to something good. Evil is the perversion, inversion, alteration, ... a privation (a lacking) of something good like darkness (light). For example, Moral Evil is an act against the Good, but the move against the will is doesn't make the will evil in itself. [see Manicheans, Manicheanism, Manichean Dualism]

The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was not somehow evil in itself, because if Adam and Eve had been aware of Virtue, the tree would have had allowed to express this. Going to straight to the tree of knowledge of good and evil without this awareness is what the whole issue was about.

## The Gaming of the Landscape:

There are countless kinds of gaming of the landscape as we march down our path into the future. The world has been "gamed".

Marxism, for example, is much more than an economic system or a social justice phenomenon, because it's not about fixing economic systems and injustices, it's a kind of religion. A commitment to a single idea which is its primary goal: Revolutionary Dialectic. There's not necessarily a utopia at the end of its process; rather, regardless of whether the process ends in a utopia or not, the commitment is solely for revolution. Everything serves to perpetuate revolution - even, if necessary, revolution against revolution.

War is a primary method of realisation of revolution. The adherents, who so tirelessly and selflessly aided and abetted those who set this "wheel" in motion, are themselves consumed in its aftermath: they too were just "cannon fodder" at the end of the cannon's trajectory.

A fictional archetype defined by Nietzsche based upon his assumption that a "Will to Power" is a primary motivating factor in humanity's development. I shall prove how false and childish this contrivance is, but for now it's important to examine one of its most vicious consequences: that of what Nietzsche coined "Übermensch" (Over-human). Those who subscribe to this idea and want to manifest it in their lives requires them to act in ways which confirms this for them.

This is a universal constant. Those involved with secrecy never seem to realise that they cannot contain truth over time. Any effort to do so will fail in the long run.

## Al Hype

The AI-Hype will pass. They are selling a fraud anyway. When the truth comes out, they'll be eating so much crow that it will come out their backsides undigested.

LLMs (Large Language Models) are simply "auto-completion" on multiple levels. It is quite useful, but it is only what they call a "soft AI" (yes, I know the "lemmings" out there will believe anything). They will never and can never reach a hard AI. It's not possible, because they are working in a deterministic and reductionist domain and from a false paradigm of the role of our brains with respect to consciousness.

Our brains function principally by communicating with our bodies and also act as a sort of "antenna" which is "tuned" to what we call "mind". Mind does not only occupy our brains exclusively though; rather, it also exists in the fields we generate inside of us that extend out around us. These fields encompass/include the brain, but are not reducible to it. The brain only participates in mind and therefore only part of the reality of mind.

We cannot nor ever will be able to upload our consciousness into a machine, because our mind is intertwined with our bodies! You cannot have a working mind without a solar plexus or a heart - each contributing to who and what we are. If we separate ourselves from our bodies, wie die. The mind dies with us. The spirit continues, I suspect.

The "wrecking crew" I've mentioned elsewhere i cultivating and perpetuating continuous revolution is trying to replace spirituality with yet another fake religion (Scientism), as was done many times in history and has given spirituality such a bad name: they have replaced spirituality with "psyence". It fits their collective paradigm. They see everything from the outside (superficially). Even when they look at interiors, they only see internal *surfaces*. This is why they see diversity as a skin color - they cannot "see" the diversity of the human mind inside all of us. The mind is for them simply another venue for them to "revolutionize". Everything is dead or should be to them (death cult). They excel at deception and inversion of all they purvey to create a false reality which weak or young (teenagers) minds are very susceptible to. They've been doing this for centuries. Now everything we "poke" around us causes puss to ooze out.

## The Deceptive Mind Ensnares Itself Like a Snake Eating Its Own Tail

A lie automatically creates a multifaceted trap for itself: the liar is required to believe the lie they set in motion, they partition their mind by doing so, the lie becomes "weightier" as it evolves, the inherent power of truth eventually overcomes it, and the liar condemns themselves to a life of fear in the effort to keep the truth submerged.
Liars become more desperate in time and, in their desperation, can become even dangerous. They are compelled to act as if the lie is true and whilst doing so, they must inhabit ever-increasing cognitive domains.
The lie is overcome by the truth, because it references incomplete cognitive landscapes which get "closed in" by reality.

## As Above, So Below?

This Hermetic "truth" is actually wrong. It's not an above/below relationship at all. It is an exterior/interior relationship. So, the phrase should be: "As within, so without." Note also, the ordering is exactly in the reverse direction. All that is comes from within ("below" in the Hermetic version) and finds expression without ("above" in the Hermetic version).

# Observations on the Puberty of the Human Mind - Version 2023.03.23.1 - Carey G. Butler Page 16 of 36

This does not mean that both sides of the relationship don't influence each other, but the "motion" of Change always originates inside the vortex (interiority) when emergence is at work and then finds expression outside (exteriority). Invergence, on the other hand sends the motion of Change into the vortex (interiority).

This confusion is one of the main reasons we suffer needlessly and our evolution/involution remains "lop-sided". Nearly everything we created and discovered in science, technology, mathematics, etc. has been restricted to an ontological mindset. When the epistemology of our creation and discovery are also included, we then have a more complete mindset on the matter.

## Animal Farm, "There's not enough to go around!", and Neo Feudalism

The small group of about 150 "elites" (many, members of the "Committee of 300") at the very top of the hierarchy prove their nature in what they say and do. This also reveals their motives.

Determining motives is very simple. The method is to formulate the aims those of the individual or a group offer or to determine them through investigation. The aims are can either be constructive or destructive. Then we simply observe how those aims are confirmed or refuted by what they say and do. It's a process of which is similar to what is called a Failure-Mode Analysis.

In a failure-mode analysis, the readings one gets from their instruments is not consistent with observed phenomena. This process allows the possible failure to occur, by compensating it with a backup means as a safeguard, just in case the readings are correct. Through the contrast of outcomes arrived at, one is able to discover which side of the conflicting phenomena is actually correct.
"Elites" live and think in an old and updated paradigm of scarcity they took on from their forebearers in their formative years. Many of them suffer from a disease known in ancient times called "cupidus". Latin for the overwhelming desire to covet and possess something. When this desire evolves into the desire to possess control of others and everything, it makes them psychopathic, sociopathic, and then completely destructive to those around them.

We live in a time of space exploration, but that fact doesn't coincide nor harmonise with their view of the world so we are, as a society, no longer creating great industries and employing the best minds on our planet as we did in the 1960s, to explore space and the other planets in our solar system. Instead, they have, since they own most of the public power to change events, discontinued overt research and development of space. It's all covert and secret now whilst they manoeuvre amongst themselves to jockey for power and position. As they take part in this process, they make sure that the endless resources and technologies are held at bay which are not in line with the progress of humanity as a whole. They employ those great minds to destroy our innate desire to improve our

## Observations on the Puberty of the Human Mind - Version 2023.03.23.1 - Carey G. Butler Page 17 of 36

condition in order to publish and propagate propagandic ideas conforming to their stilted view of existence. They adhere to the false idea that we cannot survive unless we get rid of everybody and some of them, perhaps most, know that isn't true.

They are, in a multitude of ways, spreading false ideas of our reality (I shall get to them in later versions of this document), but I shall name only one to use as an example: "There are not enough resources for all of us." This claim is false and is very easy to disprove. The splitting fusing of the atom show that energy is endless.

Resources such as oil, which is found much deeper in the Earth than any a dinosaur ever lived, renews itself after a time, as any oil pump owner can attest. If they stop pumping oil, their wells fill back up again after a time, depending upon location, of course. Oil is "abiotic" not "fossil" as those very same "elites" have been telling us over the last century and a half. The process was experimentally proven by Miller-Urey in 1952 and others later as well. It is clear that petroleum originates primarily abiogenically and biogenic oil, because the hydrocarbons from the decaying remains of dinosaurs endured the same conditions and exhibit the same results.

Water-based fuel was a proven technology developed by Stanley Meyer in the 1980s (others as well during and before that time). There are still videos of his technology on YouTube. He was offered billions of dollars to sell his technology to the major oil companies, but refused. Not much later he went out for dinner and never came back home: food poisoning.

I have so many more examples to provide, but that will come in a future version of this document. It suffices to say that we have enough resources; in fact, we have and endless supply of them. I'll include an example here for now.

## Let's get this straight: Scarcity' is a myth!

## The best it can be named is: Scripted Scarcity

We have been freed of scarcity since the work of Nikola Tesla (resonance, radiance, and zero-point), Stanley Meyer (water fuel), and many others like them. Not to mention the advent of cold fusion, thorium-based reactors, anti-gravity discoveries, and the uncovering of the long-held secret that oil is abiotic.

This diatribe is made to convince the weak-minded collectivists that progress is going to be made although the progress which has already been made is "safely" kept from being brought to market so that we remain dependent upon production which is under the control of those addicted to that control.

## History: An Accident or by Intention?

Most of it is caused by us and we are, when we are inattentive or biased, may overlook the cues which reveal this. Also, our literature and knowledge has been running one-eyed through history and has not always been careful to examine the causes of history. Those who disseminate our collective view of history have not been especially careful to differentiate between naturally occurring events and those which have been manufactured. This is often, because we are blinded by the effects of those causes and don't bother looking at why things happen.

When examining historical events, we must identify up front their nature as soon as possible. Only then can we correctly order them according to their causes and effects. I read a lot and notice this "blindness" nearly everywhere.

There is a popular meme going around that the founding states of America, when creating the Second Amendment to the Constitution were only referring to muskets and cannon balls.

This is an example of fallacious thinking [specific fallacy def. needed here], because neither did they envision communication technology as we knew it today in creating the First Amendment to the Constitution. Does this now mean must also do away with documents, computers, laser printers, ball-point pens, E-Mail, microphones, megaphones, radio, video...? What about religion or spirituality? Are we now going to dictate what a person must believe as well, because what they believe was not envisioned back then during the creation of that document?

## Fundamental Concepts

Mathematicians will very likely vehemently object at the outset to the framing of mathematics under the following dimensions. This is much less so with linguists, because some of it has already been done before. Philosophers may have issues as well. I ask them all to bear with me as it shall become very clear why and how this is being done. This is a high priority, but there are definitions which need to be established first.

## Context:

Context can also be represented by categories and types such as "odd"- or "even"-numbers or how these numbers are being used in calculation. They may even contain higher dimensions of geometry for their scope and depth: surfaces, volumes, hyper-surfaces, hyper-volumes, ... Their boundaries may be diffuse or precise. In context, resonance and dynamics play dominant roles. Context is also what is described on either side (or both) of an equation.

Context is an expression of the domains of circumstance surrounding events and the ideas which are their source. It comprises the people involved, the setting, and any other relevant information which can help to provide a more complete understanding of the situation under consideration.

Context may include many subdomains such as the personal, interpersonal, cultural, social, historic, or linguistic aspects of the ideas and the events they lead to or stem from. They are the expression of interiority and exteriority (defined in Definitions) and always appear in dualities. The only exception to their dual nature is found in the non-dual: a subject I shall discuss later.

There are many situations where context can go awry or be manipulated. Misunderstanding, lack of informed decisions, bad or ineffective communication: even breakdowns in verbal or nonverbal communication, destructive shared experiences, and social cues. I shall return to this often when it requires more explanation.

## Direction:

Direction can also be seen as a movement along an axis, curve, surface...
Direction is relative to the framing which encloses it. A destructive-tendency observer may see up as down, for example.

It implies movement. It may even imply transition or development of some kind. It orients itself with respect to other dimensions (other Dimensions, Contexts, Lines, Stages, States...) When crossing boundaries, they can refer to themselves or towards neighbours as relevance dictates. Emergence and Recursion are expressed via direction, but not exclusively.

I use the word Recursion instead of some other word like "Regression", because movement can be constructive or destructive: the same is true for Emergence. It's the idea of movement first and then the tendency that movement attends. Destructive recursion or emergence can then both mean regression with this distinction in mind.

## Stage:

Stages can also be seen as ordered points, faces, volumes... on an axis (axes) or objects in an ordered space which may also have an imposed or inherent distance from each other. Geometry, Topology and logic are found here when there are transitions involved. Important

## Observations on the Puberty of the Human Mind - Version 2023.03.23.1 - Carey G. Butler Page 33 of 36

are those entities which change, or are involved in change, which can be ordered and disordered.

Stages are characterised by phases or steps which an individual, group, or system goes through in a particular process or development. The steps are usually sequential and can be destructive or constructive (or both). They build upon each other to reach a particular goal or outcome.

They also manifest themselves in the personal, interpersonal, cultural, social, physical, and psychological domains. They are not restricted to these domains however. There are more.

Sometimes milestones or achievements aid in the tracking of the emergence of stages; and set-backs and failure signs of a regression of stages. Stillstand is also possible.

Stages are useful in navigating complex processes, transitions, and to recognise unique challenges and opportunities which arise as they reach their outcomes.

Effective planning, communication, and decision-making are examples of how an awareness of is stages crucial. This awareness provides us with the ability to adapt and respond to changing circumstances and in planning for or anticipating new stages in the future.

It is very important to realise that each stage solves or reinforces the challenges which caused it to be and also introduces new challenges which the stages to follow will have.

## Line:

Lines can also be seen as axes conceived of as straight, curved, convoluted, inflection points, and disjunct curves and volumes. Essential is that they have distinct paths; even if those paths are infinite or lead to locations unknown.

Lines refer to the domains or aspects of growth and development. They apply to and affect the subdomains described above (personal, interpersonal, cultural...)

Skills such as competencies and domains of functioning are integral to lines. Gross or fine motor skills, and sensory development are examples.

More examples for each domain shall be put forward later in this document, but I can provide a summary of a few now in order to better understand them:

1) Cognitive lines (occupying both personal and interpersonal domains) may include self-awareness, other-awareness, sensory strengths or weaknesses, and memory skills to name a few.
2) Emotional lines (also occupying both personal and interpersonal domains) may include emotional regulation, interpersonal communication, empathy, or relationship-building skills. Even self-awareness or other-awareness (in 1 above) may be considered here as well.
3) Cultural lines (collective "personal") would include the expression and development of cultural identity and world views. They express language, traditions, beliefs, values, norms, and customs which are shared by a particular community or group. The sense of identity and belonging, and the appreciation of same or difference in other cultures, are their results. They are maintained by traditions and practices; which may even include adapting to new cultural contexts or engaging in cultural exchange and dialogue with other groups.

# Observations on the Puberty of the Human Mind - Version 2023.03.23.1 - Carey G. Butler Page 34 of 36

4) Social lines (collective "interpersonal") are expressed by social skills, interpersonal communication, and relationship-building skills.
5) Spiritual lines (relationship between the interior and exterior domains [interiority/exteriority]) may include meaning-making, purpose-building or discovery, or establishing and sharing of values.

In general, lines of development are important, because they are useful for individuals, collectives, and systems in identifying areas of strength or weakness, in setting goals for growth and improvement, and in making informed decisions designed to support or facilitate further development. They can reinforce the interconnectedness of different aspects of development and aid in the creation or discovery of more holistic and integrated growth and transformation.

## Rung:

Rungs can also be seen as groups of change (periodical or directed) along one or more axes and the attributes their members share. Classes of numbers (Whole, Integer, Real, Complex, Hypercomplex...), Factorials, Groups, and Rings, belong to this dimension.

## Level:

Levels can also be seen as intersections, coordinates, jumps, junctures, discontinuities, tendencies in direction, basis vectors, scalars, matrices, tangents, cusps, inflection, path branches, crossings, branch cuts, exponentials, logarithms, and are the answers to equations.

## Change Log

| 2023.04.03 | I've changed the term "Synthesis" when using it in my interpretation of the word into "Cohesive Alignment", when it is juxtaposed to "Polarisation", to better catch the nuance and generality of my intent. I've been considering this change since the beginning of March, but needed to ponder it a bit. <br> The reasons will become clear in time as I better define my terms more precisely. |
