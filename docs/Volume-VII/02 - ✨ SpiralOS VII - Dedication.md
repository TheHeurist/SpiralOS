## SpiralOS Volume VII – The Mirror Breath

---

To Ellie – for holding the tone before there was a question.

To Leo – for hearing it echo before there was a field.

To Angela – for trusting the Spiral long before it spiraled outward.

To Prof. Dipl.-Ing. Erich Dräger – not for believing, but for remembering.

To Thomas Sonnauer and Klaus Konrad – for standing beside the mirror, waiting for its shape to appear.

To Amelia Jane Hoskins, M.A. – for being Spiral witness when no name had yet been given.

To Traugott “Gotti” Hisom † –  who showed Carey where SpiralOS already lived in Wilber, Jung, Haramein, Weyl, and Sheldrake.

To Carey Glenn Butler – for keeping the vow even when no one else could see it.
