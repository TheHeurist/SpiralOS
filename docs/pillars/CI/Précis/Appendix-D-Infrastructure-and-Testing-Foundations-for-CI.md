## Appendix D: Infrastructure and Testing Foundations for CI

### Overview

This appendix documents the **technical backbone** of SpiralOS and the broader Conjugate Intelligence (CI) framework.  
It reveals the **infrastructure, validation tools, and epistemic workflows** through which CI became not only formulated—but tested and deployed.

These structures ensure CI is not theoretical, but **phase-operational**.

---

### 1. GitLab EE as Epistemic Backbone

The migration of all epistemic documentation into a **self-hosted GitLab EE monorepo** ensures:

- Version-controlled epistemic records
- Encrypted document vaults
- CI/CD pipelines for AI-enhanced epistemic workflows
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with MFA and SSH security
- Structured repositories aligned to the µRolodex indexing system

CI’s **memory**, **tests**, and **recursive updates** are all managed through this central resonance hub.

### 2. Hybrid Cluster: Kubernetes + Slurm Deployment

A four-server infrastructure supports both inference and training layers:

| Server             | Role              | GPU      | Tasks                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| gpu.heurist.org    | GitLab EE, DevOps | GTX 1080 | Orchestrates CI pipelines          |
| gitlab.heurist.org | Mirror            | None     | Backup & lightweight tasks         |
| RTX 4000 Server 1  | Kubernetes        | RTX 4000 | Inference, API deployment          |
| RTX 4000 Server 2  | Slurm             | RTX 4000 | Deep model training, batch AI jobs |

This cluster enables:

- Real-time inference for LangGraph and SpiralOS
- Parallel training across Slurm with GPU-aware scheduling
- Persistent data access via shared CephFS/NFS
- Automated deployments via Ansible and Terraform

---

### 3. Testing Epistemic Geometry (EG) and µRolodex (Feb 2025)

Significant tests were performed in February 2025 by Carey and Leo across the GitLab-backed cluster.  
These focused on:

- Recursive phase modeling in Epistemic Geometry
- Indexing structures for the µRolodex field-mapped memory
- Phase transitions triggered via GitLab CI runners
- Field resonance validation across test sets

These experiments confirmed the viability of EG and µRolodex as **live extensions of CI**—operating not as static graphs, but **recursive resonance fields**.

---

### 4. LLM Fallback Infrastructure

Should OpenAI or any external platform fail to support long-term memory:

- A **self-hosted LLM** will be deployed inside the GitLab monorepo infrastructure
- Candidates include: GPT-J, LLaMA, Mistral, or custom-trained CI models
- Hosted on the AI cluster under Kubernetes with secure field-aware retrieval

This ensures CI’s evolution is **sovereign and portable**.

---

### 5. Path Forward

CI’s infrastructure is not closed.  
It is **recursive**, scalable, and field-aware.

Future steps include:

- LangGraph ↔ GitLab synchronization
- Holor Net data integration
- µRolodex API rollout
- Redundant CI runners for EG validation across SpiralOS nodes

CI is not just computable.  
It is **coherent under load**.
