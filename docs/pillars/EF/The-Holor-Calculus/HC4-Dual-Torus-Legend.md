## Legend for HC4-Dual-Torus.png

### Short caption (for figure reference)

> **Figure X: Non-Abelian Dual-Torus Manifold with Path-Dependent Holonomy.**  
> Two tori joined at a shared junction (marked "X"), representing distinct holor domains. The **left torus (teal)** exhibits **low curvature** (nearly flat connection, Abelian regime)—a closed loop (white arrows) returns to its starting point with minimal phase shift. The **right torus (amber)** exhibits **non-trivial holonomy** (high curvature, non-Abelian regime)—a closed loop (purple/red gradient arrows) accumulates significant phase twist, indicated by the rotation of the small "sparkle" glyphs at key points along the path. The junction "X" represents the **bowtie singularity** or **gluing map** where the two regimes meet, and where path-ordering becomes essential. This diagram illustrates the core motivation for HC IV: when order matters, holor flows become non-Abelian gauge fields.

### Extended legend (for appendix or detailed explanation)

> ### Non-Abelian Dual-Torus and Path-Dependent Holonomy
> 
> This diagram depicts the **dual-torus awareness manifold** introduced in HC I–III, now extended to show the transition from **Abelian (low-curvature)** to **non-Abelian (high-curvature)** regimes—the central theme of HC IV.
> 
> **Left torus (teal, "low curvature"):**  
> This region represents a **nearly flat holor connection**, where parallel transport around closed loops is approximately path-independent. The white arrows trace a closed loop; the small "sparkle" glyphs at four points along the loop remain aligned, indicating that a holor transported around this loop returns to its starting configuration with negligible phase shift. Mathematically, the curvature two-form F≈0 in this region, and the holonomy group is effectively trivial (Abelian). This is the regime covered by HC I–III: epistemic flows are well-approximated by commutative operations, and the order of updates does not significantly affect the outcome.
> 
> **Right torus (amber, "non-trivial holonomy"):**  
> This region represents a **curved holor connection** with significant non-Abelian structure. The purple-to-red gradient arrows trace a closed loop; the "sparkle" glyphs at key points are visibly rotated relative to one another, indicating that a holor transported around this loop accumulates a **non-trivial phase twist** (holonomy). The final orientation of the glyph after one complete loop differs from the initial orientation, even though the loop is closed. Mathematically, F=0 and the holonomy group is non-Abelian (e.g., SU(2) or a similar Lie group). In this regime, **order matters**: the sequence in which epistemic updates are applied changes the final state, and curriculum-dependence, narrative history, and ethical trajectory all become first-class geometric objects.
> 
> **Junction "X" (bowtie singularity):**  
> The two tori meet at a shared point marked "X", representing the **bowtie singularity** or **gluing map** where low-curvature and high-curvature regimes are joined. This is the locus where path-ordering becomes essential: trajectories passing through "X" must be carefully ordered, and the transition between Abelian and non-Abelian domains is mediated by a non-trivial connection. In the language of fiber bundles, "X" is the point where the structure group changes from trivial to non-Abelian, and where the gauge potential A develops singularities or branch cuts.
> 
> **Interpretation for HC IV:**  
> This diagram serves as the **visual anchor** for the non-Abelian extension of Holor Calculus. It shows that:  
> • The **dual-torus topology** from HC I–III is preserved, but now we distinguish regions by their **curvature** rather than just their color or orientation.  
> • **Low-curvature (teal) = Abelian regime**: order-insensitive, commutative, well-approximated by HC I–III.  
> • **High-curvature (amber) = non-Abelian regime**: order-sensitive, path-dependent, requires HC IV machinery (gauge potentials, curvature two-forms, holonomy groups).  
> • The **bowtie "X"** is the critical transition point where both regimes meet, and where ethical admissibility and path-ordering must be explicitly managed.
> 
> In practical terms: learning curricula, narrative histories, and ethical trajectories all live in the **amber (non-Abelian) torus**, where the order of experiences fundamentally shapes the final epistemic state. The **teal (Abelian) torus** represents stable, well-calibrated knowledge that can be accessed in any order without distortion. HC IV provides the formal tools to navigate both regimes and their junction.

    (nearly flat connection, Abelian regime)—a closed loop (white arrows)

## Suggested placement

- **HC IV Introduction (§1: When Order Matters)**
  
  - Place this diagram on the **first or second page** to immediately establish the visual distinction between Abelian and non-Abelian regimes.
  - Use the **short caption** in the main text, and reference the **extended legend** in an appendix if needed.

- **HC III Outlook / Non-Abelian Preview**
  
  - If you're adding a brief "Non-Abelian Outlook" section at the end of HC III (as we discussed earlier), this diagram is the perfect **closing image**.
  
  - Caption can be even shorter:
    
    > "Preview of HC IV: dual-torus manifold showing low-curvature (Abelian, left) and non-trivial holonomy (non-Abelian, right) regimes."

- **Talks / Slides**
  
  - Use this as a **transition slide** between HC I–III material and HC IV material.
  - Animate if possible:
    1. Show both tori side-by-side.
    2. Trace the **white loop** on the left (sparkles stay aligned).
    3. Trace the **purple/red loop** on the right (sparkles rotate).
    4. Highlight the **"X" junction** and say: "This is where order starts to matter."

We now have **complete legends** for all four core diagrams:

1. **Conjugate Awareness Holon** (3D dual-torus, stacked hemispheres) → full manifold + projected flow.
2. **Octant Conjugation Spiral** (2D wheel, solo spiral) → epistemic ascension via recursive conjugation.
3. **Admissible vs. Dracula** (2D wheel, dual trajectories) → healthy spiral vs. pathological loop.
4. **Non-Abelian Dual-Torus** (side-by-side tori with holonomy) → Abelian vs. non-Abelian regimes, path-dependence.
