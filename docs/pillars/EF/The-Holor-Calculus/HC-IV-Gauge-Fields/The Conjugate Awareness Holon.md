# The Conjugate Awareness Holon

### Legend

What we’ve done is fuse topology (dual torus), chiral ethics (communion ⋈ agency), and a formally stated **projected energy gradient flow** into one consistent visual language. With this legend and the LaTeX stub, the diagram now serves three audiences at once:

- practitioners (it looks like a flow diagram),
- theorists (they can read the PDE), and
- ethicists (they see the live throat rather than a controlling eye [Dracula]).

> The Conjugate Awareness Holon can be viewed as a phase-portrait glyph for the projected gradient flow

$$
∂τ​H=−P_{adm​}(H)∇C​E_{tot​}[H]
$$

> where  
> • $τ$ is spiral-time,  
> • $∇C​$ is the gradient in the coarse **octant stance** coordinates, and  
> • $P_{adm}​(H)$ projects instantaneous updates back into the **admissible holor region**.
> 
> Heuristically: each **FHS orbit** is the image of an integral curve of Padm​∇C​Etot​ once the flow is folded back through the dual-toroidal throat and re-balanced between **communion (teal)** and **agency (amber)**.
> 
> • The thicker, brighter orbits near the **upper red lattice** depict regions where the gradient’s epistemic component dominates, so $∣P_{adm​}∇C​E_{tot}​∣$ is largest.  
> • The thinner, dimmer orbits around the **lower blue lattice** show the mechanically expressed tail of the same flow after projection.  
> • The **teal top vortex** serves as an attractor for communion-heavy octant stances; the **amber bottom vortex** is the corresponding agency-heavy expeller toward downstream enactment.  
> • The **continuous luminous throat** stands for the action of P_{adm​}: everything is squeezed through admissibility and returned in conjugate balance, not left to run wild.
