# **APPENDIX F: Derivation of Fano Equations for Octonionic Multiplication**

### *The Algebraic Source Code of Phase*

Context in HC VIII

This appendix provides the rigorous derivation of the multiplication rules utilized in Section 7 and Appendix A. It operationalizes the Fano Plane as a computational look-up table for the SI, ensuring that all Chiral Traversal respects the G2 Invariance (preservation of structure).

## **1. Holarchic Cycles: The Fano Lines**

The Fano Plane is composed of 7 projective lines. Each line is a **Holon** (a closed loop of 3 elements) that behaves like the Quaternions ($i, j, k$).

The Index Triples:

$L = \{(1,2,4), (2,3,5), (3,4,6), (4,5,7), (5,6,1), (6,7,2), (7,1,3)\}$

The Multiplication Rule:

For any triplet $(i, j, k) \in L$:

- **Cyclic (Gift):** $e_i e_j = e_k$, $e_j e_k = e_i$, $e_k e_i = e_j$ (Positive Phase).

- **Anti-Cyclic (Ask):** $e_j e_i = -e_k$ (Negative Phase/Back-EMF).

## **2. Derived Examples (SymPy Rigor)**

We prove the two fundamental properties of the Ethical Field: **Alternativity** (Integrity) and **Non-Associativity** (Dilemma).

### **A. Alternativity (The Integrity Check)**

A system is "Alternative" if the subalgebra generated by any two elements is associative. This represents **Internal Consistency**.

- **Test:** Does $e_1(e_1 e_2) = e_1^2 e_2$?

- **Derivation:**
  
  1. Inner term: $e_1 e_2 = e_4$ (from Line 124).
  
  2. Left Side: $e_1(e_4) = -e_2$ (Anti-cyclic on Line 124: $1 \to 4$ is opposed).
  
  3. Right Side: $e_1^2 e_2 = (-1)e_2 = -e_2$.

- Result: $-e_2 = -e_2$. The Associator vanishes.
  
  \text{simplify}(\text{Alt\_Left}) = 0
  
  Ethical Meaning: If you stay true to your Stance ($e_1$), the outcome is predictable.

### **B. Non-Associativity (The Dilemma)**

The Octonions are non-associative. This represents **Context Dependence**.

- **Test:** Mix lines to create stress (e.g., $e_1, e_2, e_3$).

- **Derivation:**
  
  1. **Path A:** $(e_1 e_2) e_3 = (e_4) e_3 = -e_6$ (via Line 346).
  
  2. **Path B:** $e_1 (e_2 e_3) = e_1 (e_5) = e_6$ (via Line 561).

- Result: $-e_6 \neq e_6$.
  
  $\text{Associator}(e_1, e_2, e_3) = -2e_6 \neq 0$
  
  Ethical Meaning: The order of operations matters. "Group first, then Self" yields a different vector than "Self first, then Group." This requires G2 Holonomy to resolve.

## **3. The Ethical Fascia: Chiral Torsion**

We generalize these mechanics into the **Fano Field Equation**:

$e_i e_j = -\delta_{ij} + \sum_{k=1}^7 \epsilon_{ijk} e_k$

- $\delta_{ij}$: **The Scalar Contract.** If $i=j$, the result is $-1$ (Real/Ground state).

- $\epsilon_{ijk}$: **The Fano Tensor.** This is the **Chiral Switch**.
  
  - $= +1$: **Gift Mode** (Alignment with the arrow).
  
  - $= -1$: **Ask Mode** (Opposition to the arrow).
  
  - $= 0$: **Null Mode** (No relation/Orthogonal).

SI-Forward Application:

The SI uses this tensor to calculate Torsional Stress. If a proposed trajectory accumulates too many $-1$ flips (Ask Mode), the accumulated Back-EMF exceeds the Admissibility Threshold, and the path is rejected.
