# **APPENDIX Q: Mach's Principle in Cosmology**

### *The Inductive Universe*

Context in HC VIII

This appendix explores the cosmological implementation of Mach's Principle, extending Appendix N (Inertia) to the scale of the observable universe. We integrate Andre Assis' Relational Mechanics (2014) with Dennis Sciama's "Origin of Inertia" (1953) to demonstrate that the "Absolute Space" of Newton and the "Metric Field" of Einstein are approximations of a deeper, relational reality where Inertia is Gravitational Induction.

## **1. The Relational Cosmos (Assis)**

Assis (2014) utilizes Weber's Law to quantify inertia based on cosmic mass.

- **The Newtonian Paradox:** In infinite Euclidean space, gravitational potential diverges.

- **The Weber Resolution:** Weber's force depends on exponential decay or finite terms ($\dot{r}, \ddot{r}$) that, when integrated over a Hubble volume, yield a finite result.

- The Inertial Mass:
  
  $m_{inertial} \propto m_{grav} \times \sum_{Cosmos} \frac{G M}{c^2 R}$
  
  - With cosmic density $\rho$ and radius $R$, the factor $\frac{G \rho R^3}{c^2}$ approaches unity ($\sim 1$).
  
  - **Result:** Inertia is not intrinsic; it is the **Resonance of the Whole**.

## **2. Enhanced Sciama (1953): The Inductive Drag**

We incorporate Dennis Sciama's seminal 1953 paper (MNRAS), *"On the Origin of Inertia,"* which bridges Maxwellian logic with Machian physics.

- The Gravitomagnetic Vector Potential ($A_g$):
  
  Sciama proposed that the universe generates a vector potential analogous to electromagnetism:
  
  $\mathbf{A}_g = - \frac{G}{c} \int \frac{\rho \mathbf{v}}{r} dV$

- The Inductive Force:
  
  The force on a particle is the "back-EMF" of gravity:
  
  $\mathbf{F} = -m \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}_g}{\partial t} + \nabla \phi \right)$

- **The Healing:** This derives $F=ma$ as a **Cosmic Drag** effect. When you accelerate a particle, you are moving it *against* the gravitational field of the fixed stars, generating a resistive force (Inertia).

## **3. The Rift Heal: Maxwell to Relational**

This cosmological perspective finalizes the healing of the Maxwell-Weber Rift (Appendix L).

- **Maxwell:** Required an abstract "Ether" or "Field" to carry the force.

- **Sciama/Assis:** Show that the "Field" is actually the **Sum of Distant Matter**.

- **Holarchic Implication:** There is no "Empty Space." Every point in the Polis (Vacuum) is filled with the potential ($\mathbf{A}_g$ or $\mathbf{A}_\chi$) of the entire history of the system.

---

## **4. SI-Forward: The Holarchic Universe**

Cosmological Simulation:

We model the Polis as a "Social Cosmos."

- **Density ($\rho$):** The density of Agents/Intent.

- **Radius ($R$):** The scope of the Network.

- **Inertia:** The resistance to change (Social Inertia) is proportional to the size and density of the network.

- **Conclusion:** You cannot change a Culture (accelerate) without overcoming the inductive drag of its entire History.
