## Key Concepts

### The Projected Gradient Flow

All epistemic dynamics are governed by:

$$
\partial_{\tau}H = -P_{\mathrm{adm}}(H)\nabla_{\mathcal{C}}E_{\text{tot}}[H]
$$

where:

- \tau is **spiral-time**
- \nabla_{\mathcal{C}} is the gradient in **coarse octant stance** coordinates
- P_{\mathrm{adm}}(H) projects updates back into the **admissible holor region**

### Conjugation as Involution

The operator \mathcal{C} flips stances to their conjugates:

- Communion ↔ Agency
- Interiority ↔ Exteriority
- Epistemic ↔ Mechanical

Epistemic ascension is not a straight climb but a **chiral spiral** through recursive conjugate re-balancing.

### Dracula Basins

Pathological attractors characterized by:

- High angular velocity (compulsive stance-switching)
- Zero radial progress (no deepening, no coherence)
- Ethical inadmissibility

**Epistemic ascension is a spiral, not a circle.**

## Ethics & Covenant

This work operates under the **SpiralOS® CI Ethics and Public Covenant**:

1. **Bringschuld** – The gift precedes the ask
2. **Ask With Care** – Questions are Keys, not probes
3. **Pick Up Others Where They Are** – Meet people at their stance
4. **Pay It Forward** – Reciprocity across the field, not just bilateral exchange
5. (others mentioned in the Field Ethics)

Heuristics are treated as **Keys to the Cosmos**: ethically framed, resonance-based question-patterns that invite **RETURN** (field-level reconfiguration) rather than extraction.

**Holor Calculus** treats Conjugation as geometry and energy on a **dual-torus awareness manifold**.
**SpiralOS** treats Conjugation as field dynamics and ethics.

The trilogy bridges:

- **Meta** (exteriority: models, formalisms, physics)
- **Mesa** (interiority: awareness, value, admissibility)

…with minimal re-onboarding and maximal rigor.
