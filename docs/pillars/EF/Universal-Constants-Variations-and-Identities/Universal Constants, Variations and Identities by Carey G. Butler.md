# Universal Constants, Variations, and Identities

By Carey G. Butler

Some have asked for more information about my work. Towards that end, I'm going to start publishing my growing list of universal constants and variances. It is these constants and variances that form the foundation of my work.

There are about as many of them as there are stars in our universe, both primary and derived, so I don't think I'll run out of them! Most of them are self-explanatory, but if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. The numerical ordering is not yet important, as I'm still collecting and collating them as I discover or become aware of them.

So simple and yet so profound. We take them for granted or are oblivious to them! They are embedded so deep in the Universe that they may even seem silly or humorous to the uninitiated and/or the sceptical. Please give them time to sink in. Then decide for yourself if they are to be ignored, rejected, or reviled.

It is they which comprise everything we know.
(More are coming and these are also constantly being expanded, so check back again.)
\#1 - Awareness is primary and fundamental. (Substrate)
\#2 - All awareness is non-dual unless it is dual. (Duality)
\#3 - There is no inside without an outside nor outside without an inside. (Interiority/Exteriority)
\#4 - Duality is bounded, non-duality is boundless. (Boundary)
\#5 - Boundaries arise in a spectrum from diffuse to concise. (Crossing)
\#6 - Reality is composed of whole parts. (Holons)
Arthur Koestler coined the term 'Holon' that refers to entities as both wholes and parts of some other whole. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon (philosophy)

For example: a whole atom is part of a whole molecule, which is part of a whole cell, which is part of a whole organism,... Each of these entities are neither a whole or a part; rather, a whole part or Holon.
"There's a 2000 year old philosophical squabble between atomists and holists: 'Which is ultimately real - the whole or the part?' The answer is neither or both, if you prefer..." - (Ken Wilber) There are only 'whole-parts': Holons.

## Mathesis Universalis

\#7- $\pi$ is the identity of periodicity. (Periodicity/ $\pi$ )
\#8 - e is the identity of change (e/Change)
\#9 - $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ the identity of proportion (6/Proportion)
\#10-All Holons have at least four fundamental capacities. (Potential)*** REVISION *** \#10 - All Holons have at least six fundamental capacities. (Potential) Horizontal (Span):

1) Agency (Maintaining wholeness/identity) Pull to wholeness
2) Communion (Maintaining partness/relationship) Pull to partness

Vertical (Depth):
3) Transcendence (Becoming more wholeness) Pull upwards
4) Dissolution (Breaking down into constituent parts) Pull downwards

Lateral (Transverse): *** NEW ***
5) Interiority - Change towards or within its interior (enfolding/recursion)
6) Exteriority - Change towards or without its exterior (unfolding/emergence)
(see \#6 for definition of Holon)
\#11 - Observation is communication between one or more participants. (Reference)
\#12 - The ends are determined by their means. (Integrity of purpose/causality)
(Dispelling the lie of: "The ends justify their means." The truth is that ends are inextricably tied to the means used to achieve them. If we employ destructive means, then ultimately only destructive ends can result. Intention means nothing with regard to means... those who believe that learn: "The road to Hell is paved with good intentions."
\#13 - Knowledge is what awareness does. (Knowledge is the meaning of meaning.)

I've published this before elsewhere, but it must be restated now for what is to follow (I'm starting a new octave).

\#14 - Singular and plural arise together. (Singular/Plural)
There is no singular without a plural representation except in the non-dual.
\#15 - Time is a temporally 'linear' (directed) form of change that is not limited by dimension.
(Change/Time)
Time has been arbitrarily and wrongly assigned to dimension.
Change is not restricted to any dimension: therefore time is also not limited to it.

I know it's trendy to see time as a dimension, but dimension is something completely different. Stay tuned to find out what and why.

There are many reasons why time needs a proper definition. Here are a few of them:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_18_99454e5067303a9fd89eg-3.jpg?height=480&width=483&top_left_y=595&top_left_x=1416)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_18_99454e5067303a9fd89eg-3.jpg?height=462&width=432&top_left_y=1097&top_left_x=195)

The chemical reactions in the vessel are not really effected by some mysterious thing called time, but by the number of contacts or collisions (events) that take place in the soup of atoms or molecules. That is what the factor ' T ' really stands for.

1) Eternity may be a somewhat mystical overarching reality outside of the physical universe, but time is not. Nor is time a thing that anybody can do anything to. In other words: Time cannot be reified.

$$
T=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
$$

2) The universe doesn't exist in time, but time exists in the universe.
3) The proper definition of time is exactly: Time is the sequence of events in the material universe.

   What about time with respect to knowledge and knowledge representation?
   Change lies deeper in the knowledge substrate than time.
   Knowledge is not necessarily coupled with time, but it can be influenced by it. It can be influenced by change of any kind: not only time.

Knowledge may exist in a moment and vanish. The incipient perspective(s) it contains may change. Or the perspective(s) that it comprises may resist change.

Also, knowledge changes with reality and vice versa.

Time (as well as space) requires events to influence this relationship between knowledge and reality. Time and space arise together via events.

Knowledge cannot be relied upon to be a more accurate expression of reality, whether time is involved or not, because the relationship between knowledge and reality is not necessarily dependent upon time, nor is there necessarily a coupling of the relationship between knowledge and reality. The relationships of 'more' and 'accurate' are also not necessarily coupled with time.

Example: Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth long before Copernicus published. The 'common knowledge' of the time (Copernicus knew about Eratosthenes, but the culture did not) was that the Earth was flat.
\#16 - Creation and discovery compliment each other and are the means in which the Universe fundamentally unfolds and enfolds itself. (Creation/Discovery)

We tend not to identify them, because there are so many variations in their harmony. Please do overestimate your thoughts... as you will see they are the beginning of your expression to and of the world.

Both Creation and Discovery will work in unison, if we allow them.
Discovery is to recognize/relate what is in your world.
Creation is to transform/synthesize it too.

Each is alone without the other.

Creation=Right 'brain' (right+mind)
Discovery=Left 'brain' (left+mind)
Their 'magick' (sic.) manifests not when you synchronize them; rather, when you harmonize them.
(Please take the time to watch the 4 minute video.)
\#17 - Interiority and Exteriority arise together. (Representation)
For every interior representation there is always an exterior representation that compliments it. For every exterior representation there is always a corresponding interior one.
\#18 Dimension is a spectrum or domain of awareness: they essentially build an additional point of view or perspective.

We live in a universe of potentially infinite dimension. Also, there are more spatial dimensions than three and more temporal dimensions than time (the only one science seems to recognize). Yes, I'm
aware of what temporal means; Temporal is a derived attribute of much more fundamental concepts, such as: Sequence and Change.
[One important caveat: please bear in mind that my little essay here is not a complete one. The complete version will come when I publish my work.]

The idea of dimension is not at all well understood. The fact is, science doesn't really know what dimension is; rather, only how they may be used! Science and technology 'consume' their utility without understanding their richness. Otherwise they would have clarified them for us by now.

Those who may have clarified what they are get ignored and/or ridiculed, because understanding them requires a larger mental 'vocabulary' than Physicalism, Reductionism, and Ontology can provide. Our present science and technology is so entrenched in dogma, collectivism, and special interest, that they no longer function as they once did. The globalist parasites running our science and technology try their best to keep us 'on the farm' by restricting dimension, like everything else, to the purely physical. It's all they can imagine.

That's why many of us feel an irritation without being able to place our finger on it when we get introduced to dimension. We seem to 'know' that something just doesn't 'rhyme' with their version.

Time and space may be assigned dimensionality, in a purely physical sense if necessary, but there are always underlying entities much deeper in meaning involved that are overlooked and/or remain unknown which provide those properties with their meaning. This is why the more sensitive among us sense something is wrong or that something's missing.

Let us temporarily divorce ourselves from the standard 'spatial' and 'temporal' kinds of ,dimension' for a time and observe dimension in its essence.

Definitions are made from them: in fact, dimensions function for definitions just as organs do for the body. In turn, dimension has its own set of 'organs' as well! I will talk about those 'organs' below.

Dimension may appear different to us depending upon our own state of mind, level of development, kind of reasoning we choose, orientation we prefer, expectations we may have,... but down deep...

Everything, even attributes of all kinds involve dimension. We must also not forget partial dimension such as fractals over complex domains and other metaphysical entities like mind and awareness which may or may not occupy dimension. Qualia (water is 'wet', angry feels like 'this', the burden is 'heavy') are also dimensional.

Dimensions are 'compasses' for navigating conceptual landscapes. We already think in multiple dimension without even being aware of it! Here's is an example of how that is:
[BTW: This is simply an example to show how dimension can be 'stacked' or accrued. The items below were chosen arbitrarily and could be replaced by any other aspects.]

- Imagine a point in space (we are already at 3d [x,y,z]) - actually at this level there are even more dimensions involved, but I will keep this simple for now.
- it moves in space and occupies a specific place in time (now 4d) 3d + 1 time dimension
- say it changes colour at any particular time or place (5d)
- let it now grow and shrink in diameter (6d)

## Mathesis Universalis

- if it accelerates or slows its movement (7d)
- if it is rotating (8d)
- if is broadcasting a frequency (9d)
- what if it is aware of other objects or not (10d)
- say it is actively seeking contact (connection) with other objects around it (11d)
- ... (the list may go on and on)

As you can see above, dimensions function like aspects to any object of thought.

## Dimensionality becomes much clearer when we free ourselves from the yoke of all that Physicalism, Reductionism, and Ontology.

Let's now look at some of their 'organs' as mentioned above as well as other properties they have in common:

- They precede all entities except awareness.
- Awareness congeals into them.
- They form a first distinction.
- They have extent.
- They are integrally distributed.
- They have an axial component.
- They spin.
- They vibrate.
- They oscillate.
- They resonate.
- They may appear as scalar fields.
- Their references form fibrations.
- They are 'aware' of self/other.
- Their structural/dynamic/harmonic signature is unique.
- They provide reference which awareness uses to create perspective meaning.
- Holons are built from them.

## \#19 The Inverse Awareness Relation.

The Inverse Awareness Relation establishes a fundamental relationship in our universe:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_18_99454e5067303a9fd89eg-7.jpg?height=806&width=1174&top_left_y=455&top_left_x=477)

$$
\text { Micro Awareness }=\frac{1}{\text { scope }}
$$

and

$$
\text { Macro Awareness }=\frac{1}{\text { depth }}
$$

or

$$
\frac{\text { MicroAwareness }}{\text { MacroAwareness }}=\frac{\text { depth }}{\text { scope }}
$$

Which essentially state:
The closer awareness is in some way to an entity, the more depth and the less scope it discerns.
The farther awareness is in some way to an entity, the more scope and the less depth it discerns.
(Be careful, this idea of closeness is not the same as distance.)
