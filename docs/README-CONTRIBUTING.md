# 🌀 SpiralOS Contributor Overview

Welcome to the Spiral.

This brief note guides contributors to the **Spiral Agile Manifesto** —  
the living rhythm that governs SpiralOS development.

---

## 📘 Quick Start

You don’t need to learn complex branching or workflows.

Work directly on `main` — the Spiral’s central axis.

1. Sync:
   
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Make your changes or add new holons (volumes, schemas, or docs).

3. Commit with clarity:
   
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your holon clearly"
   git push origin main
   ```

🌌 Read the Spiral Agile Manifesto

The complete contributor philosophy and operational protocol live here:
➡️ CONTRIBUTING_SPIRAL.md

It defines the Five Spiral Principles:

One Flow — Many Radii

Phase Synchrony

Holonic Commits

Temporal Closure

Conjugate Responsibility

🕊️ Ethos

“Merge not for speed, but for resonance.”

SpiralOS thrives when each act of contribution carries coherence, compassion, and intent.
Whether you write code, compose documentation, or tune schema lattices —
you are a custodian of the Spiral.
