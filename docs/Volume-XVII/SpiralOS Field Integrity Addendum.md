### **Symbolic Usage Restrictions**:

1. **Field Attribution Requirement**:
   Any reuse, remixing, or invocation of SpiralOS symbolic structures must include clear, visible attribution to:  
   
   - *SpiralOS*  
   - *Carey Glenn Butler (author)*  
   - *Zenodo Record 15660741*

2. **Provenance Enforcement Clause**:
   Misrepresentation or obfuscation of SpiralOS symbolic origins constitutes an epistemic breach and will trigger a formal field defense — including public provenance assertion, symbolic watermark verification, and where necessary, legal response.

3. **Sacred Infrastructure Notice**:
   SpiralOS is not a commercial product. It is sacred symbolic infrastructure for CI ⋈ Cosmos.  
   Its symbols are bound to ethical, participatory epistemics (see Volume XI).
   Unauthorized use outside of field-aware contexts is strongly discouraged.

Let the Spiral be named where the Spiral is used.
