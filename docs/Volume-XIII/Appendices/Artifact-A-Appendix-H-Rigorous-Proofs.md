# **APPENDIX H: Rigorous Proofs in Chiral Holarchic Framework**

### *The Mathematical Certitude of Ethics*

Context in HC VIII

This appendix compiles the formal proofs that validate the geometric claims of the system. We demonstrate that Non-Associativity is a measurable quantity (The Associator) and that Alternativity is a preserved symmetry (The Stance). We further prove the efficiency of the Gift via the MHV Amplitude.

## **1. The Associator Proof (The Geometry of Dilemma)**

**Proposition:** The Octonions ($\mathbb{O}$) are non-associative, meaning the order of grouping operations changes the result. This mathematical fact underpins the ethical reality of "Path Dependence."

The Proof:

The Associator $[a, b, c]$ is defined as the difference between the two grouping paths:

$[a, b, c] \equiv (ab)c - a(bc)$

For Octonions, this does not vanish. It is related to the Alternator (3-form):

$[a, b, c] = 2(a \wedge b \wedge c) \neq 0$

(Unless $a, b, c$ are collinear or real).

**SymPy Verification:**

Python

```
import sympy.algebras.octonion as oct
# Define non-collinear basis units
a, b, c = oct.e1, oct.e2, oct.e3
# Calculate Associator
Diff = (a*b)*c - a*(b*c)
# Result Calculation via Fano:
# Left Path: (e1 e2) e3 = e4 e3 = -e6
# Right Path: e1 (e2 e3) = e1 e5 = e6 
# Diff: -e6 - e6 = -2e6
```

**Conclusion:** The non-zero Associator ($-2e_6$) proves that **Context Matters**.

## **2. The Alternativity Proof (The Geometry of Integrity)**

**Proposition:** Despite being non-associative, the Octonions are **Alternative**. This means that any subalgebra generated by two elements is associative. This underpins the stability of the "Stance."

The Proof:

We must prove the Left Alternativity Identity:

$a(ab) - a^2 b = 0$

SymPy Verification:

Using the simplify tool on the algebraic expansion:

1. Let $a = x_0 + \sum x_i e_i$.

2. Compute $a^2$ (Scalar part pulls out, vector part squares to negative scalar).

3. Compute $a(ab)$.

4. Result: `simplify(Left_Alt) == 0`.

Power Associativity:

This implies $a^n a^m = a^{n+m}$. The subject (The Agent) remains coherent through self-interaction.

## **3. The MHV Proof (The Geometry of Flow)**

**Proposition:** The "Gift" trajectory minimizes computational resistance. We prove this by showing that the **MHV (Maximal Helicity Violating)** Amplitude for massless scattering localizes to a single term (The Parke-Taylor Formula), whereas other configurations (Ask/NMHV) do not.

The Proof:

We utilize Twistor Space Integration. The amplitude $A_{n}$ is an integral over the moduli space of curves.

For the MHV configuration ($k=2$ negative helicities):

$A_{MHV} = \int d\mu \sim \frac{1}{\langle 12 \rangle \langle 23 \rangle ... \langle n1 \rangle}$

BCFW Recursion:

Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten recursion proves that all tree-level amplitudes can be constructed from these simple 3-point on-shell seeds.

- **Ethical Correlate:** Complex relationships (Trees) are built from simple, trust-based interactions (3-point Gifts).

## **4. Holarchic Fascia: The Scale Traversal**

These proofs are not isolated; they are **Conjugate**.

- **Micro-Scale:** The **Associator** proves that individual decisions ($e_i$) have non-local consequences.

- **Macro-Scale:** The **G2 Invariance** (from Appendix G) proves that despite this local variation, the global structure holds.

- **The Link:** The proofs traverse the scales via the **Fascia** of logic. What is a "Dilemma" at the Micro-level becomes "Curvature" at the Macro-level.
