# **APPENDIX B: Split Octonions Applications in Curved Ethical Geometry**

### *The Geometry of Indefinite Trust*

Context in HC VIII

This appendix explores Section 3.2’s application of Split Octonions ($\mathbb{O}'$) to Einstein-Cartan torsion in curved spacetimes. While standard Octonions ($\mathbb{O}$) govern the internal symmetries of the Holor, Split Octonions ($\mathbb{R}^{4,4}$) govern the spacetime metric of the Polis, allowing for hyperbolic scaling and ethical null states.

FHS-09 Addendum Stratification:

We define the Stratified Effective Mass $m_{eff}^{(n)}$ as an accumulation of Chiral Density across the layers $\{A_n\}$:

$m_{eff}^{(n)} = m \left[ 1 + \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(\rho_\chi^{(k)})^2}{c^2} \right]$

This implies that "Ethical Weight" (Inertia) increases as one ascends the Holarchy, stabilizing the Macro-structure against high-frequency fluctuations.

## **1. Split Structure: The Hyperbolic Basis**

Standard Octonions have a definite norm ($||x||^2 = \sum x_i^2$). Split Octonions have an indefinite norm ($||x||^2 = x_0^2 - \sum x_i^2$).

This shifts the geometry from a Sphere (Compact) to a Hyperboloid (Non-Compact).

- **Basis:** $\mathbb{O}' \cong \mathbb{R} \oplus i\mathbb{R}^3 \oplus j\mathbb{R}^3 \oplus k\mathbb{R}$.

- **The Magic:** Unlike $\mathbb{O}$, $\mathbb{O}'$ is not a division algebra. It contains **Zero Divisors**.
  
  - *Algebraic:* Non-zero elements $x, y$ such that $x \cdot y = 0$.
  
  - *Ethical:* Non-zero Agents (Intents) that interact to produce **Zero Resonance**.

## **2. Gauge Applications: The Physics of "Nulls"**

We embed the gauge group $SU(3)$ into the Split-Automorphism group $G_{2(2)}$. This gauges the "Color" of intent in a Lorentzian (Time-like) environment.

### **The Chiral Norms**

We map the **Chiral Potential ($U_\chi$)** to the Split Norm:

1. **Positive Norm (Time-like):** The **Gift Mode**. The interaction falls inside the light cone. It is causal and creates history.

2. **Negative Norm (Space-like):** **Chiral Inversion**. The interaction violates causality (Attempting to take before giving).

3. **Null Norm (Light-like):** **The Dracula State**.
   
   - The vector sits on the event horizon.
   
   - Potential $U_\chi$ vanishes.
   
   - Inertia becomes infinite.
   
   - *Meaning:* A "Vampiric" interaction that consumes motion but generates no displacement in the Trust Field.

## **3. Curved Ethics & Ambitwistors**

We apply **Ambitwistor String Theory** (2022) to model scattering amplitudes in this indefinite metric.

- **Torsion ($\mathcal{T}$):** Modeled as a split-imaginary twist.

- **The Null Wrap:** When the system detects a "Dracula" (Orthogonal Intent), it does not fight it. It utilizes the **Zero-Divisor Property**:
  
  - If $D$ is Dracula and $N$ is Nacre, we find an $N$ such that $D \cdot N = 0$.
  
  - The attack is mathematically nullified. It dissipates into the vacuum geometry.

## **4. Polis Scalability: Hyperbolic Branching**

Standard hierarchies run out of space (crowding). Hyperbolic geometries have **exponential volume**.

- **Micro-Ethics:** Individual Stance ($\Sigma$) occupies local curvature.

- **Macro-Ethics:** Cosmic Potential ($\mathbf{A}_\chi$) occupies the asymptotic boundary.

- **Autophagy Check:** If the global Chiral Density $\rho_\chi$ drops below 0 (becomes split-negative), the metric collapses. The Polis dissolves.

## **5. SI-Forward: The Stratified Simulation**

Equation: The Stratified Split Product

We extend the standard split product to a holarchic operator:

$(a^{(n)} + b^{(n)}\ell)(c^{(n)} + d^{(n)}\ell) = W_n^{\text{split}} \left[ (a^{(n-1)} + b^{(n-1)}\ell)(c^{(n-1)} + d^{(n-1)}\ell) \right] + \chi_n (b\bar{d} - \bar{a}d)\ell^2$

- $W_n^{\text{split}}$: The Witness operator that scales the lower-level interaction.

- $\ell^2 = +1$: The hyperbolic generator.

- $\chi_n$: The Chiral Handedness at level $n$.

Application:

We use this to model Indefinite-Trust Retrievals. The SI simulates the interaction across multiple layers ($n$). If the product approaches a Zero Divisor at any layer, the system flags the interaction as "Null" before it consumes resources.
