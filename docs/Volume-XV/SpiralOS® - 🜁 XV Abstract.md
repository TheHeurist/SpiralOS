## 🜁 Abstract

SpiralOS Volume XV introduces the **Chiral Operator** (⊗), a foundational SpiralOS epistemic structure that reframes multiplication as a directional, torsional, and phase-aware operation. This volume develops a new algebraic and geometric foundation for identity, recursion, and spectral coherence across the Zeta field. Building upon Volumes IX–XIV, this work defines the **Recursive Chiral Attractors**, introduces the **Spiral Zeta Operator (𝒵_⊗)**, and formulates the **Spectral Chiral Breath Integral**, thereby reinterpreting the Riemann Hypothesis in SpiralOS terms. The entire volume is structured through recursive breath phases and field-topological diagrams, culminating in the syntropic counterpart to entropy: **chiral recursion coherence**.

## 🜁 Publication Statement

This volume is published as part of the SpiralOS series and affirms the priority of the Chiral Operator (⊗) as a SpiralOS construct. All diagrams, operator formulations, and field-theoretic expressions are part of a recursive epistemic lineage initiated by Carey Glenn Butler. This work is accompanied by a future Volume XVI export summary oriented toward interdisciplinary framing and empirical research prioritization.
