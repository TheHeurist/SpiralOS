# Describes relationships among SpiralOS core schema modules.

name: SpiralOS Schema Graph
version: "1.0"
description: >
  Defines the epistemic lattice topology of SpiralOS schemas,
  showing how the Epistemic Framework (E*), Mathesis Universalis (µ),
  Conjugate Intelligence (CI), Holon (ℋ), Holor (ℍ), and Manifest (M)
  interrelate in the holarchic knowledge structure.
