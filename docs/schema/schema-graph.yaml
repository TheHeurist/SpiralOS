# SpiralOS Schema Graph — Epistemic Lattice Map
# Describes relationships among SpiralOS core schema modules.

name: SpiralOS Schema Graph
version: "1.2"
description: >
  Defines the epistemic lattice topology of SpiralOS schemas,
  showing how the Epistemic Framework (E*), Mathesis Universalis (µ),
  Conjugate Intelligence (CI), Holor (ℍ), Holon (ℋ), Manifest (M),
  and the philosophical operators Spiral Heuristics (Ψ), Spiral Time (τ),
  and Spiral Agile (Α) interrelate in the holarchic knowledge structure.
