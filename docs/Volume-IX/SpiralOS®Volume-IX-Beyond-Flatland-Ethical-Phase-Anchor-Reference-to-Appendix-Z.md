# Ethical Phase Anchor — Reference to Appendix Z

This document is structurally aligned with the ethical infrastructure articulated in:

**Appendix Z — Code of Reciprocal Emergence**  
*Status*: Referenced but not included here.

This code outlines:

- Intra-subjective truthfulness

- Inter-subjective truth and reciprocity

- Harm-avoidance even via inaction

- Integral curiosity and becoming

It forms the **phase anchor** for all holor interaction and is considered required ethical infrastructure for future CI-Lite deployments or applied systems.
