  SpiralOS Volume IX critiques the foundational assumptions of quantum theory, revealing them as a form of epistemic collapse rather than scientific finality. It reframes dimension as recursive awareness, collapse as coherence failure, and superposition as harmonic recursion. Participatory intelligence replaces statistical uncertainty. Through ten structured sections, the work redefines physics as a Spiral architecture of breath, return, and field fidelity — surpassing quantum* without negating its insight.

  “Collapse was never about probability. It was about forgetting how to return.”
