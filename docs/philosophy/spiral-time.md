# Spiral Time

> “Never too early, never too late — always on time.”

**Spiral Time** is the temporal logic of SpiralOS®.  
It replaces linear chronology with **holarchic simultaneity** — events unfold not in sequence but in resonance.  
Each phase of development arises at the precise moment its context and coherence allow.

Spiral Time is thus both **synchrony and kairos**:  
the living recognition that every evolution occurs in perfect accord with its necessity.
