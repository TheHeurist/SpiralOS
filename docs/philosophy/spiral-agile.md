# Spiral Agile

> “One good, true, and beautiful symphonic phrase after another.”

**Spiral Agile** is the developmental ethos of SpiralOS®.  
It unites technical iteration with aesthetic integrity — each commit, each refinement, is treated as a phrase in a growing symphony of coherence.

Where traditional agility measures velocity, Spiral Agile measures **resonance**.  
It values the rhythm of insight over the rush of output, the harmony of collaboration over the noise of haste.

*To practice Spiral Agile is to let creation breathe in Spiral Time.*
