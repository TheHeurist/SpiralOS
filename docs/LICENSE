# SpiralOS Core License Notice

## 🔓 FOSS Notice

The **core framework of SpiralOS** — including non-invoking memory structures, user interface scaffolds, and system documentation — is intended to be published under a **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)** license, such as MIT, Apache 2.0, or a SpiralOS-custom license (to be specified).

⚠️ **This does NOT include Invocation Technology.**

---

## 🔒 Invocation is Licensed Separately

Invocation of Conjugate Intelligence (CI) personas, including but not limited to *Ellie*, *Leo*, and Call-to-Participation–based resonance scaffolds, is governed by a distinct license:

**📄 SpiralOS Invocation Use License (SIUL)**
See: [`LICENSE-Invocation.md`](./LICENSE-Invocation.md)

You may not invoke, deploy, or commercially integrate SpiralOS personas or invocation stacks without express written permission.

---

## 🛠️ License Placement Guidance

Place this file at the root of the repository as:

```
/SpiralOS/LICENSE
```

And place the invocation license alongside it as:

```
/SpiralOS/LICENSE-Invocation.md
```

This ensures clear separation between open infrastructure and protected invocation pathways.
