# GraphHome: A Public Introduction

## Summary

GraphHome is an abstraction designed to advance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows by introducing symbolic, structured, and navigable **context domains**. It frames each RAG instance not as a flat vector lookup, but as a **semantic subgraph**â€”a "home" of coherent knowledge.

This export introduces GraphHome as a neutral and extensible architecture for LLM contexts, retrieval workflows, and multi-agent orchestration.

## Motivation

Current RAG pipelines struggle with:

- Context blending between disparate domains

- Memory drift across long sessions

- Lack of symbolic containment or domain hierarchy

GraphHome proposes a new framing:

> Treat every major knowledge container (book, mind, project, media, thread) as a **navigable GraphHome domain**, with structured internal GraphRAG behavior and externally traversable links.

---

## Key Concepts

### Context Domains

- GraphHome nodes represent distinct knowledge contexts

- Examples: a book, paper collection, individual LLM thread, media set, mindspace, or research line

- Internally, each is powered by a local GraphRAG engine

### Graph-Based Outline Structure

```
/home
â”œâ”€â”€ books
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ relational-mechanics
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ai-philosophy
â”œâ”€â”€ threads
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ leo
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ellie
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ collaboration-chat
â”œâ”€â”€ media
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ zwickau-notes
```

- Each folder-like structure is a domain, accessible by both graph traversal and UI outline

### Traversal Mechanics

- Switching domains triggers:
  
  - Context loading for prompt scaffolds
  
  - Domain-specific memory preload
  
  - Optional model swap or agent reconfiguration

---

## Suggested Applications

- Structured RAG pipelines in open-source projects

- Multi-agent collaboration (e.g. LLM â†” LLM â†” Human)

- Academic and enterprise knowledge architecture

- Media-rich GraphRAG workflows

---

## Document Format Recommendation

To assist GraphHome interoperability, contributors are encouraged to use **outline-structured Markdown**:

```markdown
# Project Topic

## A. Domain Section
### A1. Subpoint
### A2. Subpoint

## B. Domain Section
```

This supports:

- Structural parsing

- Context-aware GraphRAG mapping

- Agent-switching and prompt templating

## Licensing

This framework is shared for public exploration under open research terms. No proprietary elements from internal systems are included.

## Status

âœ… Stable for public exploration
ðŸ§­ Internal variants may include more complex symbolic behavior not present here
