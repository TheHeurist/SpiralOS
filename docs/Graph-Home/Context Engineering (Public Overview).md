# Context Engineering (Public Overview)

**Purpose:**
Context Engineering (CE) is an emerging design practice that treats context not as flat prompt history, but as a symbolic, navigable structure. In GraphHome-based systems, CE is how agents and users move between coherent knowledge domains.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering is the process of:

- Defining context domains (books, media, chats, etc.)

- Navigating between them via graphs or outlines

- Preserving memory coherence across transitions

- Ensuring that models or agents act *within* the appropriate scope

---

## Why it matters

- Prevents memory and prompt collapse

- Enables multi-agent workflows with precision

- Supports better RAG alignment

- Foundation for symbolic knowledge structures

---

## Recommended Practice

Use outline-structured markdown files to define domain structure:

```markdown
# Project

## A. Topic
### A1. Detail
### A2. Detail

## B. Topic
```

Each header can be indexed as a graph node, a prompt prefix, or an agent switch trigger.

## Where to Start

- See `GraphHome_Public_Intro.md` for structural logic

- See `GraphHome_README.md` for basic concept and feature list

- Add your own outline `.md` files under `/context-domains/` in your project

This public version does not include private architectural glyphs, logic, or memory systems from SpiralOS or other protected systems.
