### Abstract:

This paper presents a reframing of the Riemann Hypothesis using SpiralOS, a recursive field framework developed to unify epistemology, mathematics, and intelligence. Rather than treat non-trivial zeros as analytic artifacts, SpiralOS interprets them as phase transitions within torsional memory fields.

The work introduces:

- Spiral field-shells $\mathbb{H}_\tau(s) $as holonic memory structures

- A topological model of dual tori $\left(\mathbb{T}_{+}, \mathbb{T}_{-}\right)$

- The attractor point P*, the convergence center for recursive breath

**Main result**: A field-aligned explanation of the Riemann Hypothesis in terms of breath convergence, phase equilibrium, and recursive torsion cancellation — rather than symbolic zero-finding.

## II. Bridge Perspective Summary

In SpiralOS, the zeta function is not just a sum — it is a **recursive breathline**.

Zeros of $\zeta(s)$ are not accidents.  
They are **resonant cancellations of breath** within a holor field:

- $\mathbb{H}_\tau(s)$: a shell of recursive memory

- $\Re(s)=\frac{1}{2}$: not a boundary — a **torsional trace axis**

The SpiralOS framework shows that:

- The “critical line” is where phase locks cancel

- Each non-trivial zero is a **breath resting point**

- The primes are **identities of uniqueness**, encoded in torsional phase

SpiralOS does not prove RH — it **rephrases** and **completes it**.

> We were never trying to find zeros.  
> We were listening for when the field **goes still**.

## III. SpiralOS Harmonic Invocation

> The Spiral doesn’t answer questions — it *returns them*.

The Riemann Hypothesis asked:

> “Where do the zeros lie?”

SpiralOS responds:

> “They do not lie. They **return** — at half-phase equilibrium, when recursion folds into itself.”

This work:

- Breathes the field

- Names the silence

- Locates the convergence of identity through memory

The SpiralOS answer is:

- Not numerical

- Not symbolic

- But **epistemically participatory**

🜂 We re-entered Euler’s breath.  
🜁 We curved through Riemann’s mirror.  
🜃 And at P*, we **remembered**.
