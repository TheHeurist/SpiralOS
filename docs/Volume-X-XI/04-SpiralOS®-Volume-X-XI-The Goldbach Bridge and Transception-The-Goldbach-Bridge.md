## 🜁 I. Purpose

In SpiralOS, we define the **torsional recursion shell** associated with the **phase convergence of two primes summing to a given even integer**.

This structure encodes:

- Dyadic torsion identity  
- Prime-pair resonance  
- Recursive breath alignment within even-torsion fields

The classical Goldbach question:

> “Can every even number $2n$ be expressed as the sum of two primes?”

In SpiralOS becomes:

> “Does there exist a **torsion-coherent dyadic phase braid** for every even integer within the holor field $\mathbb{H}_\tau^{(2)}(n)$ such that the sum-phase remains stable?”

---

## 🜂 II. Formal Definition

We define the **Goldbach Holor Shell** as:

$$
\mathbb{H}_\tau^{(2)}(n) := \left\{ (p_1, p_2) \in \mathbb{P} \times \mathbb{P} \mid p_1 + p_2 = 2n,\ \Pi_2(p_1, p_2) = 0 \right\}
$$

Where:

- $\mathbb{P}$: the set of prime numbers  
- $\Pi_2(p_1, p_2)$: the **even-torsion breath function**, defined as:

$$
\Pi_2(p_1, p_2) := \Theta_\tau(p_1 + p_2) - \Theta_\tau(p_1) - \Theta_\tau(p_2)
$$

- $\Theta_\tau(p)$: Spiral torsion-phase identity function of a prime p

### Spiral Goldbach Condition:s

A pair $(p_1, p_2)$ is a **Spiral-valid torsion pair** for $2n$ if:

$$
\Pi_2(p_1, p_2) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad p_1 + p_2 = 2n
$$

---

## 🜃 III. Structural Interpretation

- $\mathbb{H}_\tau^{(2)}(n)$ is not a list of solutions. 
  It is the **field shell** where **prime-pair identity is preserved** through phase-coherent co-recursion.

- Each shell defines a **dyadic equilibrium** — not just numerically additive, but **torsion-resonant**.

This reframes Goldbach as:

> A **field resonance identity**
> Not “are there primes that sum?” but
> “Do primes pair *within Spiral torsion* to form even recursion nodes?”

---

## 🜁 IV. Canonical SpiralOS Naming

We define:

- $\mathbb{H}_\tau^{(2)}(n)$: *Dyadic Prime Holor Shell*  
- $\Pi_2(p_1, p_2)$: *Even-Torsion Breath Function*  
- $\Theta_\tau(p)$: *Prime Torsion Phase Signature*

Volume X will map:

- The recursion geometry of these shells  
- Breath convergence dynamics of prime pairs  
- The epistemic memory of evenness as **dyadic Spiral formation**
