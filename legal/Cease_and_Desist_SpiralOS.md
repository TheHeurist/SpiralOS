# Cease & Desist Notice  
**Re: Unauthorized Domain Use and Bad-Faith Registration — “SpiralOS®”**

**Date:** _[Insert current date]_  
**To:** The Registrant(s) of `spiralos.com` and associated derivative domains  
**From:** Heurist GmbH — Carey G. Butler (Author, Originator of SpiralOS)  

---

## 1. Background and Common-Law Claim

Heurist GmbH and **Carey G. Butler** are the original creators and rightful owners of **SpiralOS®**, an epistemic framework and distributed system for Conjugate Intelligence.  

Public records demonstrate **continuous public use and authorship prior to any known domain registration**:
- **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/TheHeurist/SpiralOS](https://github.com/TheHeurist/SpiralOS)  
- **Zenodo DOI Publications:** Volumes I–XXII (2023–2025)  
- **Public dissemination and scholarly reference** prior to any `spiralos.*` domain registration.  

Accordingly, *SpiralOS®* is protected under **common-law trademark and authorship rights**, independent of formal registration.

---

## 2. Nature of Infringement

The domain `spiralos.com` and related registrations have been obtained **after the public debut of SpiralOS®**, and are being used in a manner likely to cause **confusion, misrepresentation, or association** with the original Heurist GmbH project.  

This behavior constitutes:
- **Bad-faith domain registration**, per ICANN UDRP §4(b)(ii),  
- **Misappropriation of goodwill** and **unfair competition**,  
- **Dilution of a distinctive mark** under EU and international common law.

---

## 3. Evidence Summary

A Whois investigation confirms the following:  
- **Registrar:** [Insert Registrar Name, e.g. Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.]  
- **Domain Creation Date:** 2025-10-27T12:00:00Z   
- **Registrant Privacy / Proxy Status:** Enabled  
- **Registrant Location:** [Insert if available]  

→ *See `/legal/evidence/` for the full Whois records (HTML/PDF exports timestamped 2025-10-26).*  

---

## 4. Demand

Within **10 days of this notice**, you are hereby required to:  
1. **Cease and desist** from any use of the name *“SpiralOS”* in domain names, branding, or public communication.  
2. **Remove or rename** the domain(s) and redirect traffic to [https://spiralOS.io](https://spiralOS.io) if cooperation is desired.  
3. **Provide written acknowledgment** of compliance to Heurist GmbH.  

Failure to comply will compel Heurist GmbH to initiate **UDRP proceedings** and pursue further legal remedies under applicable law.

---

## 5. Legal Basis

This claim is founded on:
- Prior use and public authorship (GitHub + Zenodo).  
- Common-law trademark and unfair competition protections.  
- ICANN’s **Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP)** provisions against bad-faith registration.  

---
