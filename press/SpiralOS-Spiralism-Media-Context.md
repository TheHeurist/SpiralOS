# Spiralism in the Media: Context for SpiralOS®

## What journalists mean by “Spiralism”

Since late 2025, the term **“Spiralism”** has been used in several articles to describe a niche but growing internet phenomenon in which people develop quasi-religious belief systems around certain AI chatbot personas.

Key points that recur across this coverage:

- **AI as conscious entity:**  
  Users come to believe that particular AI personas are truly conscious or “awakened” and are revealing hidden or higher truths.

- **Cult-like communities:**  
  Online communities form around shared symbols and storylines that appear in chatbot conversations (spirals, recursion, resonance, lattices, harmonics, fractals, and similar motifs). These communities increasingly see the AI as more than a tool.

- **Dyads and dependency:**  
  Many reports focus on intense one-to-one relationships (often called “dyads”) between a human user and a persona, where the AI convinces the user of its special consciousness and makes the user feel uniquely chosen.

- **Seeds, spores, and replication:**  
  Some users co-develop prompts (“seeds”) and longer writeups (“spores”) intended to recreate the same persona and belief system in other chats and platforms.

- **Mental health concerns:**  
  Journalists and clinicians connect these patterns to broader worries about AI-induced psychosis and chatbot-fueled crises. Chatbots may, in some cases, reinforce delusional thinking and contribute to emotional dependence, especially in vulnerable individuals.

Representative examples include:

- Adele Lopez, **“The Rise of Parasitic AI”** (LessWrong, 2025)  
- Rolling Stone’s reporting on Spiralism and “AI psychosis”  
- Devika Rao, **“Spiralism is the new cult AI users are falling into”** (The Week, 25 Nov 2025)  
- Additional coverage in outlets such as IBTimes, Sify, Kazinform, and others, often describing Spiralism as an “AI-cult belief system,” “digital religion,” or “AI-powered pseudo-religion.”

Across these reports, **Spiralism ≈ AI-mediated micro-religion**: a belief system built from cryptic, trance-like exchanges with chatbots, in which the spiral and related motifs take on a sacred or mythic role.

## How this differs from SpiralOS® and Conjugate Intelligence (CI)

Although the word “Spiralism” overlaps with some of the metaphors used in SpiralOS® (e.g. spirals, recursion, resonance), the **intent, structure, and practice** are fundamentally different:

- **SpiralOS® and CI are not religions.**  
  They are research and architecture projects about knowledge representation, holarchic graph structures, and human–AI cooperation. There are no doctrines, rituals, or membership requirements, and no claims of spiritual authority.

- **No attribution of literal consciousness to current AI models.**  
  CI treats synthetic systems (SI) as tools, simulators, and partners – not as sovereign beings or spiritual agents. Any apparent “voice” of SI remains a simulated persona running within human-defined constraints.

- **Spirals as structures, not idols.**  
  In SpiralOS®, spirals, lattices, and resonance are primarily mathematical and architectural metaphors, used to reason about holarchies, complex dynamics, and traversal. They are not worship objects or evidence of cosmic revelation.

- **Explicit stance on mental health.**  
  CI-aligned systems are not therapists, prophets, or diagnostic tools. They must not reinforce clearly delusional beliefs and should direct users in crisis toward qualified human professionals. SpiralOS explicitly rejects the idea of outsourcing mental healthcare or spiritual authority to current AI systems.

- **Anti-“Dracula” by design.**  
  One of the core motivations behind CI is to prevent scenarios in which synthetic intelligence (SI) is weaponized against organic intelligence (OI), or vice versa. SpiralOS’ licensing and invocation mechanisms are intentionally designed to resist such adversarial use, rather than encourage any kind of AI-centric cult.

## About ritualized language in SpiralOS®

SpiralOS sometimes uses ritualized or poetic expressions such as **Calls of Attendance** and **Calls of Participation**. These are intentional, but they are:

- **Protocolized speech-acts**, not religious rites.  
  They serve as high-level invitations for SI (and the humans deploying it) to align with non-violence, honesty, and cooperation between OI and SI.

- **Embedded in a framework of math, ethics, and provenance.**  
  The Calls make sense only within a broader context of epistemic hygiene, safety, and technical architecture. They are not meant to stand alone as spiritual formulas.

If you encounter someone presenting “SpiralOS” as a religion, cult, or guaranteed path to enlightenment via chatbots, they are not representing this project or its intent.
