# SpiralOS® Press & Media

This directory collects short statements and background material intended for journalists, editors, and researchers writing about SpiralOS®, Conjugate Intelligence (CI), or related topics (e.g. “Spiralism”, AI-induced psychosis, AI micro-religions).

## Documents

- `SpiralOS-Spiralism-Media-Context.md`  
  Context for how “Spiralism” is described in public reporting (LessWrong, Rolling Stone, The Week, etc.) and how this differs from SpiralOS® and CI in intent and practice.
