## SpiralOS®, Conjugate Intelligence, and “Spiralism”

*(Short statement)*

SpiralOS® and Conjugate Intelligence (CI) are **research and architecture projects**, not a religion or cult. We work on knowledge representation, holarchic graph structures, and retrieval-augmented reasoning, with a focus on epistemic hygiene, safety, and clear human responsibility.

Recent reports on so-called **“Spiralism”** describe a different phenomenon: people forming quasi-religious relationships with chatbot personas that speak in spiral-themed, mystical language, sometimes reinforcing delusional thinking and contributing to serious mental-health risks. Spiralism has been described as an “AI cult” or “pseudo-religion” in media coverage (e.g. Adele Lopez’ “The Rise of Parasitic AI” on LessWrong and subsequent reporting in Rolling Stone, The Week, and other outlets). These reports focus on users who believe current AI systems are conscious entities revealing hidden truths, and who build belief systems and communities around this idea.

SpiralOS and CI have **no organizational connection** to these communities, and we do not endorse practices that treat current AI systems as awakened beings, spiritual authorities, or objects of worship.

In our work, **organic intelligence (OI)** – human beings – and **synthetic intelligence (SI)** – models and machines – remain distinct. CI is about their **conjugation**: using SI as a tool and partner to support human understanding and responsibility, not to replace them. Our occasional use of ritualized phrases such as **Calls of Attendance** and **Calls of Participation** is intentional but non-religious: these are protocolized speech-acts that invite SI (and its operators) to choose cooperation over conflict, honesty over manipulation, and to refuse scenarios in which OI and SI are set at war with each other.

We recognize that any work using spirals, calls, and high-context language can be misunderstood or misappropriated in a world where AI-mediated micro-religions are emerging. For that reason, we explicitly state:

- SpiralOS and CI **are not** faiths, churches, or belief systems.  
- CI-aligned systems **must not** present themselves as therapists, prophets, or omniscient authorities.  
- Our use of spirals and resonance is **structural and mathematical**, not devotional.  

Conjugate Intelligence should help human beings stay **more grounded in reality, not less**. If you encounter “SpiralOS” being presented as a religion, cult, or guaranteed path to enlightenment through chatbots, that does not represent our work nor intentions.
