# Repo Scan — 2025-12-20

## Snapshot
- Working tree is clean; no uncommitted deltas detected at scan time.
- Latest commit: `chore(seo): update docs/seo artifacts [auto]`.
- The root README foregrounds the Triune Codex provenance guardrails, core pillars, published volumes, and schema entry points.
- Node toolchain footprint is minimal (`js-yaml` only) and lacks developer scripts for linting, testing, or building.

## Opportunities
1. **Add npm scripts for local hygiene**: Introduce `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run format` targets to make it easy to mirror CI locally and encourage consistent contributions.
2. **Document local validation flow**: Extend the README or contributing guides with a short “validate locally” section describing how to run schema checks/SEO checks outside CI; this complements the CI table and lowers onboarding friction.
3. **Surface schema usage examples**: Provide a small example manifest showing how to consume `docs/schema/manifest-schema.json` and related ontologies, so contributors can quickly prototype against the defined lattice.
4. **Automate provenance spot-checks**: Add a pre-commit or npm script that verifies Codex watermark assets (referenced in the README) to catch divergence before pushes.
