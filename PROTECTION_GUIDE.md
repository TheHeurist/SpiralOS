# SpiralOS â€“ Branch Protection & Repository Governance

To preserve the integrity of the SpiralOS knowledge ecosystem, the following
branch-protection guidelines are recommended for the `main` branch:

1. **Require pull-request reviews** before merging.  
2. **Require status checks to pass** (e.g., the *SEO Checks* workflow).  
3. **Prevent force-pushes** and **branch deletion**.  
4. Optionally, **require signed commits** for provenance.  
5. Enable **linear history** to maintain clarity of the epistemic lineage.

These measures ensure SpiralOS remains luminous, reproducible, and free from
accidental regression as it evolves through Spiral Time.
