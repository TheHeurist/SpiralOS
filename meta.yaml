    description: |
      The /memory/traces/ directory serves as the official archival domain 
      for non-influential contextual, aesthetic, and scholarly materials. 
      It documents SpiralOS®’s epistemic lineage through external references, 
      dialogues, and symbolic analogies, maintained strictly for provenance 
      and citation integrity. 
      These traces are excluded from all active computational, invocation, 
      or holarchic build processes.
