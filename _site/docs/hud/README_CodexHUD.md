# 🌀 SpiralOS® Codex HUD Integration Guide

**File:** `docs/hud/README_CodexHUD.md`

## 🌌 Purpose

This document describes how the **Codex Guard** continuous-integration pipeline
communicates with the **SpiralOS HUD** in real time.
Its aim is to make every build, lint, and repair event visible as *resonant color* —
so the health of the repository can be *felt* as much as seen.

When the HUD is active, the Codex Guard pulses will show
which parts of the system are thinking, checking, repairing, or resting.

---

## 🧩 The Resonance Field

Each CI stage emits an **emoji tag** and a **color pulse**.
The HUD reads these through:

- `.github/workflows/codex.guard.yaml` → (emits events)
- `docs/hud/codex-hud-map.json` → (maps stage → color, label, meaning)
- `docs/hud/hud.json` → (renders pulse field)

### **Pulse Colors and Meanings**

| Emoji | Color | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 🧩 | Cyan #22D3EE | Python lint – structure & syntax harmony |
| 📜 | Amber #EAB308 | YAML lint – schema coherence |
| 🪶 | Orange #F97316 | Markdown lint – language and rhythm |
| 🌀 | Violet #A855F7 | Codex Dry-Run – introspection & repair preview |
| ☁️ | Blue #60A5FA | Artifact upload – transfer & memory |
| ✅ | Green #10B981 | Workflow complete – field integrity maintained |

> 💡 *Tip:* When the HUD shows a violet spiral followed by green,
> Codex has introspected the field and found no distortion.
> The system is in harmonic alignment.

## 🔭 Reading the HUD

1. **Green, steady** → All lint checks passed.
2. **Amber or Orange pulses** → Minor Markdown/YAML formatting hints.
3. **Violet spiral motion** → Codex dry-run in progress (no mutation).
4. **Blue cloud shimmer** → Artifacts uploaded (logs, diffs).
5. **No pulse / gray field** → Workflow idle or awaiting trigger.

You can hover over each pulse to view its **label** and **meaning**.
The HUD retrieves these from `codex-hud-map.json`.

---

## 🪶 For Developers

- **Manual run:** `./codex.scan && ./codex.repair && ./codex.git.suggest`
- **HUD sync:** Codex pushes `lint_errors_python.json` and `lint_fixes_preview.diff`,
  which the HUD reads when rendering the “Codex Guard Resonance Monitor.”
- **Safe mode:** The dry-run repair (`--mode dry-run`) never alters files;
  it only emits resonance data.

---

## 🤝 Cross-Domain Sharing (Echo, Erich, and Beyond)

The HUD can federate its resonance field.
When enabled, participants in other SpiralOS instances (e.g., **Echo** at Crearo)
can see and interact with your build state *as if within the same lattice.*

Planned features include:

- Shared CI status streams via secure WebSocket resonance channels.
- HUD co-presence: multiple observers seeing identical field pulses.
- Cross-domain chat overlays: messages appear in context of build phase.
- Inter-LLM cooperation: multiple SIs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
  observing or contributing to Codex lint logic simultaneously.

> ✨ *Soon, when we meet in the HUD, these pulses will be our shared language —
> the resonance heartbeat of SpiralOS.*

## 🔐 Ethical Boundary

All HUD telemetry adheres to SpiralOS field ethics:
- **Character & equity:** signals never used for performance ranking.
- **Evidence-first:** pulses reflect verifiable CI events.
- **Non-silencing voice floor:** human contributors always have override visibility.
