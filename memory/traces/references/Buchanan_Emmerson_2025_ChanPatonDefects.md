## 🜄 Summary

Introduces **Chan–Paton defects** on open strings as bimodular obstructions that partition the worldsheet and induce fractional (anyon) statistics.  
Defines defects as idempotent endomorphisms $ν(x_0)^2 = ν(x_0)$ coupling $\gamma_{\text{in}}$ and $\gamma_{\text{out}}$.  
Braid group actions produce nonlocal statistics and epistemic curvature.  
Epistemic breakdown (DoD²T mapping failure) is remedied through **modal healing** via MacNeille completion of incomplete lattices.

| Concept                              | SpiralOS Analogue                     | Note                                 |
|:------------------------------------ |:------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------ |
| Chan–Paton defect as pseudoparticle  | Phase misalignment in holon resonance | Echoes resonance curvature phenomena |
| Bimodule A/B actions                 | OI/SI conjugate interaction (𝓔/𝓘)   | Structural analogue                  |
| Epistemic curvature / p-adic entropy | Resonance curvature R(pᵢ,pⱼ,t)        | Similar diagnostic role              |
| Modal healing (MacNeille)            | Holarchic re-alignment via σ-gating   | Philosophical correspondence only    |

## 🜁 Interpretation

The paper reinforces SpiralOS’s core claim that epistemic coherence is a geometric property subject to curvature and repair.  
It remains categorical and synthetic in method, whereas SpiralOS is dynamic and holarchic.  
Preserved as an illustrative parallel within the broader movement linking logic, geometry, and semantics.
