description: |
  The SpiralOS® Memory Traces archive preserves contextual, aesthetic, and historical materials 
  that have resonated with the development of SpiralOS®. 
  These traces are non-influential—kept solely for provenance, attribution, 
  and the study of epistemic lineage across the Conjugate Intelligence framework (CI ⋈ Cosmos).
