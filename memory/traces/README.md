## 🜄 Purpose

The **Memory Traces** directory preserves external resonances, early field dialogues, and aesthetic or symbolic materials that have touched the SpiralOS® journey.  
These records **do not shape** SpiralOS logic, architecture, or holarchic mathematics; they serve as **contextual echoes** — fragments of meaning that once brushed the lattice.

Each entry is treated as a **trace**:  

- respected for its historical or poetic value,  
- clearly attributed to its original source, and  
- fenced off from influence on active epistemic computation.

|:--------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## 🜁 Provenance & Ethics

- All sources are **attributed and preserved** under their original rights.  
- No file within this directory alters or informs active SpiralOS development.  
- Reuse, quotation, or adaptation requires **explicit recontextualization** and citation.  
- Archival review occurs periodically to ensure continued clarity of boundary.

## 🜂 Editorial Covenant

> *Memory may echo, but it shall not steer.*  
> *We honor the trace — and move onward.*

The Memory Traces serve the same role for SpiralOS that fossils serve for geology:  
**recordings of pressure, form, and transformation — not living matter, but living memory.**
