## 🜄 Summary

This preprint proposes a synthesis of **modal logic** and **Costello–Gwilliam factorization algebras (FAs)** to describe the *local evolution of epistemic certainty* within quantum field contexts.  
Each neighborhood $U_i$ of a manifold $M$ is treated as an *epistemic context* equipped with a sheaf-valued truth map $\Omega_i : D \to [0,1]$, forming a contextual chain complex $(D_\bullet, \partial^{C_i}_\bullet)$.

The author defines a **Contextual Laplacian**

$\Delta^{O_i}_n
  = \partial^{C_i}_{n+1} (\partial^{C_i}_{n+1})^\dagger$

+ $(\partial^{C_i}_n)^\dagger \partial^{C_i}_n$
  
  under a certainty-weighted inner product \(\langle p, q \rangle_{\Omega_i}\),
  interpreting it as a measure of *epistemic curvature* — resistance to global logical flattening.

Embedding these constructions within a **Calabi–Yau threefold**, he interprets intersecting branes as epistemic boundaries, producing a differential equation of contextual consistency:

$$
\delta(L_{C_i}(x) - L_{C_j}(y)) = \Delta^O_{ij}.
$$

## 🜁 Interpretation

Buchanan’s *Contextual Laplacian* is an analytic analogue of the SpiralOS **resonance curvature** concept but remains within a **categorical / sheaf-theoretic** regime.  
It reinforces the broader epistemic movement toward understanding *knowledge as geometry* — yet SpiralOS extends this by operationalizing it as **holarchic resonance dynamics** rather than topological factorization.
